\section{Introduction}

The previous chapter has detailed the theory of the proposed models to build lagrangian injectors for initialising dispersed phase simulations, named Smart Lagrangian Injectors (SLI). These models, nowadays in its earliest state of maturity, are intended to be generic and applicable to a broad range of operating conditions and injector configurations. To show its capabilities, they have been developed in their first stage with resolved simulations of liquid jet in crossflow (JICF) configuration. This chapter details these simulations, performed with the software YALES2 \citepColor[moureau_design_2011]. % \textbf{https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1631072110002111?token=9137B6903478D4E8E427F5D8218DFC3EB42446DB034970B14BA9DE87AA7E80D130124A7EF8D8608D21D5D465CCE05A4F&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20210524114835}

The fundamentals and the physics of non-reactive JICF have been introduced in $\S$\ref{sec:ch1_fuel_injection_technology}. This chapter shows the results, analysis and injectors obtained from a kerosene JICF simulation replicating the experimental facility tested by \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002]. This configuration is used for validating the models. Section \ref{sec:ch5_experimental_bench} displays the experimental test bench, whose numerical setup and operating conditions chosen for numerical computations are detailed in Section \ref{sec:computational_setup}.


\section{Experimental test case}
	\label{sec:ch5_experimental_bench}

The experimental configuration tested by \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] is shown in Figure \ref{fig:experiment_JICF_DLR}. The test rig is shown at the left. Liquid kerosene is injected through the atomizer ports to a quartz glass duct of rectangular cross section $25$x$40$ mm$^2$. The duct inlet is located at $120$ mm upstream the injection port. The boundary layer thickness developing along the bottom of the duct has been measured experimentally just upstream the atomizer, being between $4$ and $5$ mm. The lateral walls allow for optical access from the atomizer port until a location at 100 mm downstream. Air is introduced through two separate channels, a main one and a supplementary one. The main airflow is injected at the inlet of the quartz duct, while the supplementary one passes around it. Both airflows merge at the end of the duct and leave the domain through a common exit acting as a sonic throttle. The velocity inside the quartz can then be tuned by varying the size of the nozzle and the supplementary air flow rate. In the experiments performed, the range of air velocities goes from $u_g = 50$ to 100 m/s and the range of pressure from $p$ = 1.5 to 15 bar, hence allowing the study high-pressure conditions. The air temperature is maintained to $T_g = 290$ K. The fuel tested was kerosen Jet A-1 with density $\rho_l = 795$ kg m$^{-3}$ and surface tension $\sigma = 22 \cdot 10^{-3}$ N m$^{-1}$.

The liquid injection nozzle can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:experiment_JICF_DLR} right. It consists of a plain jet nozzle of $d_\mathrm{inj} =  0.45$ mm diameter and $L/d_\mathrm{inj}$ ratio of 1.56 with sharp edges. The average discharge coefficient for the mass flow rates of interest in the experimental studies is $0.6$. More details on the test rig can be found in \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1997].

\end{figure}


A correlation for the trajectory of the jet was obtained experimentally by analysing optically its penetration for the several operating conditions tested. It corresponds to the trajectory of the jet's windward side, and gives a relation between the vertical location $z$ with respect to the axial coordinate $z$ as a function of the nozzle diameter $d_\mathrm{inj}$ and the momentum ratio $q$ defined by Eq. (\ref{eq:q_and_We_JICF_parameters}): % The rorrelation has a standard deviation of 0.81.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:jicf_trajectory_becker}
    \frac{z}{d_\mathrm{inj}} = 1.57 \mathrm{q}^{0.36} \ln \left( 1 + 3.81 \frac{x}{d_\mathrm{inj}} \right)
\end{equation}



\section{Computational setup}
	\label{sec:computational_setup}

\subsection*{Numerical domain and baseline mesh}

Figure \ref{fig:numerical_setup_maquette_JICF_DLR} shows the computational domain developed to replicate the simulations of the test bench shown in Figure \ref{fig:experiment_JICF_DLR}. The duct is modelled as a plenum consisting of a box of dimensions 25x40x270 mm$^3$. The hydraulic diameter of the duct cross section, which is used to calculate the gas Reynolds number, is $D_h = 30.8$ mm. A magnified view of the nozzle is also shown, with diameter $0.45$ mm and straight section length of 0.7 mm prior to injection to keep $L/D = 1.56$ as in the experiments. The boundary conditions are also indicated. The plenum walls use a wall law of logarithmic type except closer to the domain pressure outlet, which have been set to slip walls to avoid backflow. The nozzle walls are rigid walls. For the liquid inlet, a Poiseuille profile has been specified, while in the gaseous inlet a mean velocity profile has been set in order to recover the boundary layer thickness of between 4 and 5 mm upstream the injection nozzle as described in the experiments (see Appendix \ref{app:JICF_BL_setup} for details). Due to the high Reynolds number at the gaseous inlet (see Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}), synthetic turbulence is added in the liquid inlet with a fluctuating value $u' = 0.1 u_g$ and a characteristic eddies size $l_e$ equal to one-sixth the channel height.

\begin{figure}[ht]

      \label{fig:numerical_setup_maquette_JICF_DLR}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh} shows the baseline mesh, where the symmetry plane at $y = 0$ is displayed. It is composed of 28 million tetrahedral cells. The baseline cell size in the channel upstream liquid injection is 1.5 mm, while the cells located in the downstream region have an average size of 3 mm. The grid is refined at the near-field region to 0.7 mm and inside the discharge section of the liquid nozzle to $20 \mu m$. This mesh is used at the beginning of all the simulations performed, but then it change dynamically in each simulation as more liquid is introduced in the domain due to the AMR routine that refines the mesh at the liquid-gas interface ($\S$\ref{sec:YALES2}). Simulations are performed with the ACLS methodology describe in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch2_ACLS}.

	\label{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Operating conditions}

Two operating conditions tested experimentally in \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] have been simulated. Both of them have the same momentum ration $q = 6$ but differ in the Weber number: $We_g = 830$ (low Weber) and $We_g = 1470$ (low Weber). According to the values of $q$ and $We_g$, the former condition corresponds to surface breakup dominating regime while the latter is located at the dividing line between column and surface breakup. Figure \ref{fig:location_JICF_ops_in_breakup_map} shows the location of both operating points in the breakup map of \citeColor[wu_breakup_1997]. The physical magnitudes and dimensionless numbers of both operating points are shown in Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}. Apart from the values $q$ and $We_g$, the dimensionless numbers in  Eq. (\ref{eq:dimensionless_numbers_jicf}) are also calculated: the liquid and gaseous Reynolds numbers $Re_g$ and $Re_g$ respectively, Ohnesorge number $Oh$, aerodynamic Weber $We_\mathrm{aero}$, relative Weber $We_\mathrm{rel}$ and density ratio $r$. These numbers have been added since they are defined in several experimental studies \citeColor[wu_breakup_1997,becker_breakup_2002,ragucci_trajectory_2007] to characterize the operating points tested. 

For performing the computations of resolved atomization, the ACLS methodology combined with the AMR routine described in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch2_ACLS} is used. For each simulation, two interface mesh sizes have been simulated: $\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 20 ~\mu m$ (coarse case) and $\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 10 ~\mu m$ (fine case). Therefore, a total of four simulations have been done. The nomenclature for each simulation, which is used hereafter in this document, is introduced in Table \ref{tab:jicf_resolved_simulations_performed}.

%\subsection{Spray sampling in resolved simulations}

\subsection{Numerical computation of jet trajectory}
	\label{sec:ch5_jicf_trajectories}

One of the most important characteristics of a jet in crossflow is its trajectory (see $\S$\ref{sec:ch1_fuel_injection_technology}). This feature will determine how far the jet penetrates in the domain and has a paramount effect on the latter evaporation and mixing processes, hence affecting the flame dynamics. Experimental studies often provide correlations for the trajectory of the windward side of the jet (see Table \ref{tab:correlations_experimental_JICF}), such as the one from Eq. (\ref{eq:jicf_trajectory_becker}). These correlations depend on factors such as the momentum flux ratio $q$, the injection diameter $d_\mathrm{inj}$ and, in some case \citepColor[ragucci_trajectory_2007], in the Weber number $We$. The overall dependency of the trajectory on these parameters is still unknown.

It is therefore of interest, to obtain the trajectory for the jet penetration in the performed resolved simulations. 

Several methods can be used for this purpose. This section describes four possible methodologies, two based on processing instantaneous trajectories and two based on processing the mean $\psi$ field. The results obtained with these methodologies are shown in $\S$\ref{sec:results_JICF_resolved}.

\subsubsection*{Methods based on instantaneous trajectories}

\subsubsection*{Methods based on the mean levelset field}

Another possibility to obtain mean trajectories is by using the mean field of the levelset function, $\overline{\psi}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:ACLS_psi_definition}). 

\paragraph{Maximum gradient method}

This method is more similar to the experimental methods presented in \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] and \citeColor[freitag_spray_2008], since they obtain the trajectory as the contour giving the maximum intensity gradient in the vertical direction in processed images of the mean jet.

\begin{equation}
\max \left( \nabla \overline{\psi} \right)

\subsection{Direct measurement of liquid fluxes}
\label{subsec:ch5_interior_boundaries}



Droplet sampling is performed by tracking the center of mass of resolved structures and checking when it crosses the sampling planes. 


The sampling procedure of droplets is based on a lagrangian tracking of their center of mass. The position of the center of mass before and

In the ACLS simulations, a 

Mass flow rates are defined by Eq. (\ref{eq:mass_flow_rate_definition_general}).

Liquid flow rates are calculated from the levelset function $\phi$ with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
Q_l = \int_{\partial \Omega} \phi \left( \textbf{u} \cdot \textbf{n} \right) dS
\end{equation}

where $\partial \Omega$ is the surface where integration is performed (i.e. the interior boundary), $\textbf{u}$ is the velocity and $\textbf{n}$ is the normal to the plane.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results_JICF_resolved}


\subsection{Definition of characteristic times}

In order to analyse the convergence and results of the four simulations performed, it is useful to relate the simulation times to characteristic times relating the liquid. Three characteristic times are considered in this work:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item $\tau_\mathrm{liq}$: the characteristic liquid phase time from \citeColor[ranger_aerodynamics_1968], defined as:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\tau_\mathrm{liq} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_l}{\rho_g}} \frac{d_\mathrm{inj}}{u_g}
	\end{equation}
	
	\item $\tau_\mathrm{ph}$: a characteristic physical time of the JICF, defined as:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:jicf_tau_injector}
	\tau_\mathrm{ph} = \frac{d_\mathrm{inj}}{u_l}
	\end{equation}

	\item $\tau_\mathrm{str}$: the characteristic time from ligaments stripping from the dense core. This value is obtained by counting the number of liquid structures that emanate from the liquid column in a given time period.

\end{itemize}

For each simulation, the different characteristic times are defined in Table \ref{tab:jicf_characteristic times}. The values $\tau_\mathrm{liq}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{ph}$, depend obviously on the operating condition and not on the mesh resolution, since they are have been obtained from mathematical formulas. On the other hand, the characteristic time $\tau_\mathrm{str}$ has been obtained from each simulation and a dependency on the mesh resolution employed can be expected.

The accuracy of the mean numerical trajectories can be quantitatively assessed by defining a $L_2$ error as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:L2_JICF}): 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:L2_JICF}
    L_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}   \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{z}{d_\mathrm{inj}} \Bigr|_{\mathrm{exp},i} -   \frac{z}{d_\mathrm{inj}} \Bigr|_{\mathrm{num},i} \right)^2}

\subsection{Direct measurement of liquid flow rates}

Liquid fluxes have been measured in the resolved simulations at the planes shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_interior_boundaries_surface_measurements}. In the coarse simulations done with a mesh resolution of $\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 20 \mu m$, fluxes have been obtained in all planes shown in the sketch. For the fine simulations, results were collected up to x = 10 mm since the liquid was removed shortly afterwards.

\subsubsection{Deformation variation with axial distance}

\subsubsection{Granulometry}

Sprays generated by atomization processes can be characterized by means of distributions. A given spray where the sizes of the droplets are known can be studied by representing distributions which express the probability of finding a droplet diameter or volume in that spray. Size distributions are usually representing by the notation $f_0 \left( D \right)$, while volume distributions are denoted by $f_3 \left( D \right)$. Two types of distributions are possible: discrete (histograms) or continuous. In the former, the spectrum of droplets size is divided into several range of droplets named bins or classes, and the number of droplets comprised within each class each counted. Histograms are the usual way of representing the granulometry when the size of droplets is directly available, such as in most experimental campaings and computational studies resolving atomization. Continuous distributions, however, are often used to fit discrete distributions obtained experimentally and are used for making simplified models for spray injection in lagrangian simulations, since they can represent the spray by functions depending on few parameters. Examples of function widely used in sprays are the lognormal, Rosin-Rammler and Nukiyama-Tanasama distributions \citepColor[lefebvre_atomization_2017]. 

Since in the resolved simulations performed in the work the size and volume of droplets are known (formally, the volume is known but the size is estimated with Eq. \ref{eq:ch4_r_equivalent_calculation}), probability histograms can be plotted. Figure \ref{fig:JICF_histograms_ug100_dx20} shows size (left) and volume (right) histograms for the sprays obtained from the case UG100\_DX20. The number of classes has been calculated according to Rice's rule, which estimates this value as $N_\mathrm{bins} = \sqrt[3]{2 N_\mathrm{dr}}$ \citepColor[terrel_oversmoothed_1985].




Size distributions can be represented by means of histograms relating the probability of finding a droplet with a given size with respect to the diameter, $f_0 \left( D \right)$.

\textbf{Log-normal distribution}. This distribution function is more representative of certain types of atomizers, such as the spray produced by the jet in crossflow. In contrast to the normal distribution, the log-normal distribution takes the logarithm of the particle diameter as a variable. It is given by the following expression, where $\overline{D}_{ng}$ is the geometric mean size of the logarithmic droplet size and $s_g$ is the geometric standard deviation:

\begin{equation}
 f_0 \left( D \right) = \frac{d N}{d D} =  \frac{1}{D  \sqrt{2 \pi \ln \left( s_g \right)^2}} \exp \left[ - \frac{1}{2 } \left( \frac{\ln D - \ln \overline{D}_{ng}}{\ln s_g}   \right)^2 \right]
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\overline{D}_{ng} = \exp \left(  \frac{\sum_i \ln D_i }{N_\mathrm{droplets}} \right) 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
s_g = \exp \sqrt{  \frac{\sum_i \ln \left( D_i / \overline{D}_{ng} \right) ^2 }{N_\mathrm{droplets}} }
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Definition of characteristic times}

Several characteristic times can be defined in a jet in crossflow:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Characteristic time of ligaments passage at given planes, $t_\mathrm{pas}$
	
	\item Characteristic time related to the frequency of the instabilities causing column breakup, $t_\mathrm{ins}$
	
	\item Physical definition according to ...

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frequential analysis}

A spectral analysis is performed to obtain the characteristic breakup frequencies. There are several ways to obtain the desired frequencies:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique (2018 Prakash, Mukundan). This is out of the scope of this work.
	
	\item Get evolution of breakup point with time: $x_b \left( t \right)$, $z_b \left( t \right)$, then get the frequency spectrum  (2010 Wang, 2018 Prakash). Not sure we can do this with our available data, so not envisageable now.
	
	\item Locate probes along liquid column, get liquid presence rate with time. This is the one !!
