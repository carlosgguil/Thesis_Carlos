\section{Introduction}

The previous chapter has detailed the theory of the proposed models to build lagrangian injectors for initialising dispersed phase simulations, named Smart Lagrangian Injectors (SLI). These models, nowadays in its earliest state of maturity, are intended to be generic and applicable to a broad range of operating conditions and injector configurations. To show its capabilities, they have been developed in their first stage with resolved simulations of liquid jet in crossflow (JICF) configuration. This chapter details these simulations, performed with the software YALES2 (\textbf{ref:2011-moureau-design}). % \textbf{https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1631072110002111?token=9137B6903478D4E8E427F5D8218DFC3EB42446DB034970B14BA9DE87AA7E80D130124A7EF8D8608D21D5D465CCE05A4F&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20210524114835}

The fundamentals and the physics of non-reactive JICF have been introduced in $\S$\ref{sec:ch1_fuel_injection_technology}. This chapter shows the results, analysis and injectors obtained from a kerosene JICF simulation replicating the experimental facility tested by \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002]. This configuration is used for validating the models. Section \ref{sec:ch5_experimental_bench} displays the experimental test bench, whose numerical setup and operating conditions chosen for numerical computations are detailed in Section \ref{sec:computational_setup}.

Numerical simulations are validated with the experimental correlation obtained by~\cite{ref:Becker2002} for the vertical jet penetration. It has been obtained by testing experimentally several operating conditions, and has a standard deviation of value $0.81$. The correlation corresponds to the trajectory of the jet's windward side, and is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:jicf_trajectory_becker}
    \frac{z}{d_\mathrm{inj}} = 1.57 \mathrm{q}^{0.36} \ln \left( 1 + 3.81 \frac{x}{d_\mathrm{inj}} \right)
\end{equation}

The accuracy of the mean numerical trajectories can be quantitatively assessed by defining a $L_2$ error as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:L2_JICF}): 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:L2_JICF}
    L_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}   \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{z}{d_\mathrm{inj}} \Bigr|_{\mathrm{exp},i} -   \frac{z}{d_\mathrm{inj}} \Bigr|_{\mathrm{num},i} \right)^2}
\end{equation}

\section{Numerical computation of jet trajectory}
	\label{sec:ch5_jicf_trajectories}

As explained in $\S$\ref{sec:ch1_fuel_injection_technology}, one of the most important features of a jet in crossflow is its trajectory. Experimental studies (\textbf{ref?}) often provide correlations for the trajectory of the windward side of the jet, such as the one from Eq. (\ref{eq:jicf_trajectory_becker}). These correlations depend on factors such as the momentum flux ratio $q$, the injection diameter $d_\mathrm{inj}$ and, in some case (\textbf{ref:Ragucci}), in the Weber number $We$. The overall dependency of the trajectory on these parameters is still unknown and an ongoing research topic.

It is therefore of interest, to obtain the trajectory for the jet penetration in the performed resolved simulations. Several methods can be used for this purpose. This section describes four possible methodologies, two based on processing instantaneous trajectories and two based on processing the mean $\psi$ field. The results obtained with these methodologies are shown in $\S$\ref{sec:results_JICF_resolved}.

\subsection{Methods based on instantaneous trajectories}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Methods based on the mean levelset field}

Another possibility to obtain mean trajectories is by using the mean field of the levelset magnitude, $\overline{\phi}$. 

\subsubsection*{Maximum gradient method}

This method is more similar to the experimental methods presented in \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] and \citeColor[freitag_spray_2008], since they obtain the trajectory as the contour giving the maximum intensity gradient in the vertical direction in processed images of the mean jet.

\begin{equation}
\max \left( \nabla \overline{\phi} \right)
\end{equation}

Several characteristic times can be defined in a jet in crossflow:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Characteristic time of ligaments passage at given planes, $t_\mathrm{pas}$
	
	\item Characteristic time related to the frequency of the instabilities causing column breakup, $t_\mathrm{ins}$
	
	\item Physical definition according to ...

\subsection{Frequential analysis}

A spectral analysis is performed to obtain the characteristic breakup frequencies. There are several ways to obtain the desired frequencies:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique (2018 Prakash, Mukundan). This is out of the scope of this work.
	
	\item Get evolution of breakup point with time: $x_b \left( t \right)$, $z_b \left( t \right)$, then get the frequency spectrum  (2010 Wang, 2018 Prakash). Not sure we can do this with our available data, so not envisageable now.
	
	\item Locate probes along liquid column, get liquid presence rate with time. This is the one !!
