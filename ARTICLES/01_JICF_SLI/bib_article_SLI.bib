	title = {Large {Eddy} {Simulation} of a prefilming airblast atomizer},
	abstract = {A Large Eddy Simulation of an academic experiment is performed with an unstructured, explicit in time, gaseous flow solver (AVBP). The configuration is a planar prefilming atomizer designed and manufactured at KIT-ITS. Results of the simulation are compared to experiments in terms of air velocity profiles, film thickness, drop size distribution and spray angle. The different forms of the liquid phase (film and spray) are described by a Lagrangian approach. The film model is built upon a depth-averaged method and a new approach for primary atomization is presented, based on the parametrization of a Rosin-Rammler function to describe the drop size distribution. Preliminary results indicate a good agreement with measurements, with regards to the predicted drop size probability function and the predicted spray angle.},
