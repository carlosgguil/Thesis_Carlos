\section{Introduction}

The mesh shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh} is used. However, this grid shows a baseline cell size downstream liquid injection coarser to the upstream region, which will affect the resolution of the gaseous field. Another mesh should be used for this study, this is discussed in the mesh convergence section.

The operating points simulated are those from Figure \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}.

\subsection{Evaporation phenomena}

\textbf{Note: this analysis could perfectly be in the previous chapter}.

As indicated in Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}, the temperatures of both liquid kerosene and gaseous air are low (290 and 288 K respectively) and there is not direct evaporation of fuel. Nevertheless, some evaporation can occur at ambient temperature if the vapour pressure of the liquid is lower than the ambient pressure. In the experiments, the ambient pressure is $p_g = 6$ bar, while the vapour pressure of kerosene at $288$ K is $p_{vap} = 0.003$ bar \citepColor[shepherd_flash_2000]. Therefore, evaporation might be possible.

It is tested that ... Two characteristic times are used in the low We case (since the lowest velocity is found there, and the droplets take more time to reach the validation plane at 80 mm)/

\begin{itemize}

	\item The time that a droplet takes to reach the plane x = 80 mm. From the SPS results in $\S$\textbf{??} (or Table \textbf{??}), the first droplets at x = 10 mm are obtained at $t_{resolv} = 0.3$ ms after injection. Then, the first droplets injected at this location in the lagrangian simulations reach the validation plane after $t_\mathrm{lagr} = $ ms. Hence, a characteristic time defined as the :
	
	\begin{equation}
	\tau_{validation} = t_{resolv}  + t_\mathrm{lagr}
	\end{equation}
	
	\item Evaporation time rate is used by means of the $d^2$ law. This law that the square of the droplet's diameter diminishes linearly with time:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:d2_law}
	d^2 \left( \right) = d_0^2 - K t
	\end{equation}
	
	
	where $K$ is the evaporation rate and $d_0$ the initial diameter of the droplet. The value K ... (see 2006 Ghassemi).
	
	
	\text{NAH}. The evolution in diameter after a given time $t$ can then be obtained as:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta d^2 = d_0^2 - d^2 \left( \right) = K t
	\end{equation}
	

\end{itemize}

\section{Relation between volume and mixture fractions}

So we can relate $\overline{\alpha}$ field with the mixture fraction somehow, this will be interesting for people doing combustion. I have developed the following relation between mixture fraction $Z$ and volume fraction $\alpha$ (need to check it properly):

\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{m_F}{m_F + m_A} = \frac{V_F \rho_F}{V_F \rho_F + V_A \rho_A} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{V_A}{V_F} \frac{\rho_A}{\rho_F}} = \frac{1}{1 = \frac{\rho_A}{\rho_F} \frac{1 - \alpha}{\alpha}}
\end{equation}


We can also make a link to heat relase, for the interest of combustion studies.

\section{Experimental results}

In the configuration of \textbf{ref:2002-becker}, there are experimental results we can use for comparison at x = 80 mm. These include maps of SMD and flux (see Figure \textbf{XX}). We can also validate with quantitative results obtained by integrating the flux and SMD along the $y$ direction:

\begin{equation}
\langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_y} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) dy ~~~~; ~~~~ \langle SMD \left( z \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_y \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dy
\end{equation}

In the same fashion, the results can be integrated along the $z$ direction to yield dependence with the $z$ axis:

\begin{equation}
\langle q_l \left( y \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_z} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) dz ~~~~; ~~~~ \langle SMD \left( y \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_z \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dz
\end{equation}

\subsection{Trajectories}

In order to illustrate the lagrangian trajectories and the continuity with respect to the resolved jets, a volume fraction field can be defined in the lagrangian simulations:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_l \left( \textbf{x}, t \right) = \frac{V_l \left( \textbf{x}, t \right)}{V_{el}}
\end{equation}

where $V_{el}$ is the volume of the element in the eulerian mesh grid. Therefore, the volume fraction is a magnitude defined in the main eulerian grid. Since the dispersed phase is not directly represented in this grid but by lagrangian particles, $V_l \left( \textbf{x}, t \right)$ is calculated by interpolating the volume of the particles located within each element at each iteration.

\subsection{Frequential analysis}

Several probes have been located in the outer part of the jet to see the spectra. See Figures \ref{fig:probes_dx10m} and \ref{fig:probes_dx20m} for volume fraction probes, and Figure \ref{fig:probes_U_planey0} for determining velocity spectra at plane y = 0. These are available at pilotage 30-04-2021.
