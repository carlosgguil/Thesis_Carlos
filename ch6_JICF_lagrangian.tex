\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents results from lagrangian simulations performed with the SLI models described in Chapter \ref{ch4:sli_development}. The test case used is the academic JICF of \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002], for which resolved simulations of the atomization process were detailed in Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}. Data for these computations are used to build the injectors in order to run dispersed phase simulations in the same configuration, which are less computationally expensive than the resolved ones and can reach further spatial locations due to the absence of AMR. 

Firstly, the computational setup is described, whose only difference with the baseline mesh of the resolved atomization simulations is the mesh size at the center. Then, the available data for experimental validation of the simulations are summarized in $\S$\ref{sec:ch6_experimental_results}. Possible sources and values for the uncertainties of these data are then discussed in $\S$\ref{sec:jicf_dlr_experimental_uncertainty}, and previous numerical works on injection in the same configuration are summarized in $\S$\ref{ch6:previous_numerical_studies}. Then, the boundary conditions the gaseous and liquid phases in dispersed-phase simulations are detailed in $\S$\ref{sec:ch6_BC_gaseous_phase} and $\S$\ref{sec:JICf_LGS_liquid_BCs} respectively. For the former, two possible options are analyzed: the ALM method, which was introduced in Chapter \ref{ch4:sli_development}, and another proposed methodology based on prescribing statistics of the gaseous phase learnt from resolved simulations in a simplified channel. It is shown that the prescribed gas phase can retrieve better the gaseous phase features from the resolved case than the ALM. Then, dispersed-phase simulations are performed by testing the different input parameters to find the best configuration to experimental data. It is found that secondary atomization acts very soon after droplets injection, reducing the particles sizes along the channel first with a fast, exponential decrease and then with a slow, linear reduction. The lagrangian computations are specially sensitive to the gaseous boundary conditions, secondary atomization model, SLI resolution and the mean velocities prescribed. Overall, the tests performed with the high Weber operating point show good spray features but underestimate the global SMD of the spray by a 37 $\%$ in the best of the cases. This deviation is reduced to 20 $\%$ when changing to the low Weber operating point, indicating that the SLI methodology could work better at low speed configurations where either atomization is better resolved by the resolved computations, or the secondary atomization model breaks droplets to a lesser extent. Finally, a delay in the secondary atomization is introduced by unplugging the secondary atomization model and let lagrangian particles convect without breaking, relaxing towards the gaseous field before breakup takes place. As a result, the deviations in droplets sizes are improved, confirming that it is the relative velocity what mostly affects breakup and creates the underestimation for the unaltered configuration.


\section{Computational setup}

The geometry replicating the experimental test bench is the same than the one used for the resolved simulations, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:numerical_setup_maquette_JICF_DLR}. The operating points simulated are detailed in Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}. Regarding the mesh employed, it was shown in $\S$\ref{sec:ch5_initial_conditions} that an element size of $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm allows to transport the estimated turbulence in these cases. Nevertheless, the simulations from Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations} use a mesh with this cell size only inside the plenum upstream and around the injector, while downstream the injector the mesh size is enlarged as there is no liquid at this region. This mesh was shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh}. In the lagrangian simulations performed in this chapter, injection is performed at the sampling planes downstream the injector seen in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_IBs_sketch_discretization}, and the region of interest extends up to a location at $x = 80$ mm downstream the injector, which corresponds to the location where the experiments from \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] report results on fluxes and SMD. Therefore, lagrangian simulations use a baseline cell size of $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm in the plenum from the gaseous inlet up to $x = 85$ mm downstream the injector in order to allow for turbulent transport up to the experimental validation plane (located at $x = 80$ mm). The mesh used, shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh_LGS}, is composed of $74 \cdot 10^6$ elements, being therefore heavier than the baseline mesh employed for the resolved simulations but eventually lighter due to the lack of AMR (see the increase of element size in the resolved simulations at Figure \ref{fig:JICF_nelem_increase_t_0_to_2}, which shows that the smallest mesh obtained for a established jet contains $200 \cdot 10^6$ elements). Liquid particles are injected in this mesh as lagrangian point-particles whose dynamics follow the equations from  $\S$\ref{sec:ch3_EL_formalisms}. The energy equation is not considered since the test bench is at ambient temperature and evaporation does not take place.


%The geometry replicating the experimental test bench is the same than the one used for the resolved simulations, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:numerical_setup_maquette_JICF_DLR}. The operating points simulated are the ones from Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}. Regarding the mesh employed, it was shown in $\S$\ref{sec:ch5_initial_conditions} that an element size of $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm allows to transport the estimated turbulence in these cases. Nevertheless, the simulations from Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations} use a mesh with this cell size only inside the plenum upstream and around the injector, while downstream the injector the mesh size is enlarged as there is no liquid at this region. This mesh was shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh}. In the lagrangian simulations performed in this chapter, injection is performed at the sampling planes downstream the injector seen in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_IBs_sketch_discretization}, and the region of interest extends up to a location at $x = 80$ mm downstream the injector, which corresponds to the location where the experiments from \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] report results on fluxes and SMD. Therefore, lagrangian simulations use a baseline cell size of $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm in the plenum from the gaseous inlet up to $x = 85$ mm downstream the injector. Furthermore, the mesh is refined \hl{in the region immediately downstream the injection nozzle to} $\Delta x = 0.3$ mm to allow for a better resolution of the gaseous field perturbed by the ALM, as the turbulent structures from the resolved simulations reported in $\S$\ref{ch5:subsec_turbulent_structures_in_gaseous_field} have smaller characteristic sizes than the turbulence further upstream. It is, however, worth to keep in mind that the gaseous field close to the interface was refined in the resolved simulations to the interface mesh size, allowing for a better resolution of turbulence. This refinement is not available in the dispersed phase simulations, therefore the refinement to $\Delta x = 0.3$ mm. The mesh used, shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh_LGS}, is composed of \textbf{XX} elements, being therefore larger than the baseline mesh employed for the resolved simulations but eventually cheaper due to the lack of AMR, as simulations. Liquid particles are injected in this mesh as lagrangian point-particles whose dynamics follow the equations from  $\S$\ref{sec:ch3_EL_formalisms}. The energy equation is not considered since the test bench is at ambient temperature and evaporation does not take place.

%\section{Evaporation phenomena}
%
%\textbf{Note: this analysis could perfectly be in the previous chapter}.
%
%As indicated in Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}, the temperatures of both liquid kerosene and gaseous air are low (290 and 288 K respectively) and there is not direct evaporation of fuel. Nevertheless, some evaporation can occur at ambient temperature if the vapour pressure of the liquid is lower than the ambient pressure. In the experiments, the ambient pressure is $p_g = 6$ bar, while the vapour pressure of kerosene at $288$ K is $p_{vap} = 0.003$ bar \citepColor[shepherd_flash_2000]. Therefore, evaporation might be possible.
%
%It is tested that ... Two characteristic times are used in the low We case (since the lowest velocity is found there, and the droplets take more time to reach the validation plane at 80 mm)/

%\begin{itemize}
%
%	\item The time that a droplet takes to reach the plane x = 80 mm. From the SPS results in $\S$\textbf{??} (or Table \textbf{??}), the first droplets at x = 10 mm are obtained at $t_{resolv} = 0.3$ ms after injection. Then, the first droplets injected at this location in the lagrangian simulations reach the validation plane after $t_\mathrm{lagr} = $ ms. Hence, a characteristic time defined as the :

%	
%	\item Evaporation time rate is used by means of the $d^2$ law. This law that the square of the droplet's diameter diminishes linearly with time:

%	\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:d2_law}
%	d^2 \left( \right) = d_0^2 - K t

\section{Experimental results from literature}
\label{sec:ch6_experimental_results}

The study from \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] reports results on the droplets average size SMD and the liquid volume fluxes in the plane $x = 80$  mm perpendicular to the crossflow. In the resolved simulations of Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations} the liquid spray could not reach this location: the increase in mesh size due to a continuous liquid injection and formation of droplets due to atomizatio yielded computations unfeasible if liquid was allowed to travel too far downstream, and hence the liquid domain was restricted up to $x = 10, 15$ mm for the fine and coarse resolutions respectively. This limitation does not apply in the dispersed phase simulations, which can be transported up to the outlet of the domain due to their lower cost compared to the resolved ones. Therefore, the dispersed phase simulations will be compared to the experimental results presented at 80 mm.

Experiments results from PDA measurements can be found in the articles \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] and \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002]. Among those, quantitative maps of SMD and volume flux are given, which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_Becker_expe_results}. For both operating points, the volume flux shows a circumferential pattern where the largest flux is located at the center and is reduced radially. Most of the fuel is then located at the center of the spray plume, which is a common feature in liquid jets in crossflow \citepColor[wu_spray_1998]. The maximum value of volume flux is lower for the low Weber case than in the high Weber one, which is expected since the injected liquid mass flow rate is lower for the former than for the later to keep the same momentum flux ratio $q$ in both cases, as Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions} shows. Regarding the $SMD$, both maps show a ballistic, layered profile where the largest droplets are located in the top part of the spray. This is due to the higher inertia of the biggest droplets produced, which penetrate further than the smallest ones \citepColor[wu_breakup_1997]. In general, $SMD$ values are larger in the low Weber case since the dynamic pressure (or equivalently, the gaseous velocity) is lower, and the size of the droplets produced were found to be highly dependent on this parameter \citepColor[becker_breakup_2002].

Complementary to the maps, qualitative results are also present in the literature which can also be used for validation. These ones are given as the integrated profiles of the liquid volume flux and flux-averaged $SMD$ over the $z$ and $y$ directions, which are then respectively dependent on $y$ and $z$. The equations to obtain such measures are given by Eqs. (\ref{eq:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}):


\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}
\begin{align}
\langle q_l \rangle \left( z \right)  = \frac{1}{L_y} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) dy    & ~~~~  ; & \langle SMD \rangle \left( z \right) = \frac{1}{L_y \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dy \\
\langle q_l  \rangle \left( y \right) = \frac{1}{L_z} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) dz    & ~~~~  ; & \langle SMD \rangle  \left( y \right)  =  \frac{1}{L_z \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dz
\end{align}
\end{subequations}


%\begin{equation}
%\langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_y} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) dy ~~~~; ~~~~ \langle SMD \left( z \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_y \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dy
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\langle q_l \left( y \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_z} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) dz ~~~~; ~~~~ \langle SMD \left( y \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_z \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dz
%\end{equation}

The application of these equations to the experimental results yield the curves from Figure \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}. The integrated volume flux over $y$ (Figure \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results_over_y}) shows an increase of the volume flux from the bottom part of the spray (PDA measurements closer to wall, for $z < 2$ mm, could not be performed \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002]) until the spray center, where the maximum flux is reached. Then, the flux decreases with $z$ until there is no more liquid present. Flux values are generally larger for the high $We$ point than for the low $We$ one, and the quantity of liquid extends up to further upstream for the former than for the latter due to its larger liquid velocity at injection. Regarding the SMD profiles, both cases follow a ballistic behaviour. The spray of the high $We$ point contains droplets of larger mean size than the low $We$ one.

With respect to the profiles integrated over $z$ (Figure \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results_over_z}), both SMD and flux lines follow parabollic profiles with the largest values present at $y = 0$, i.e. the coordinate for which the largest fluxes are found. The behaviour of the profiles depending on the operating point follow the same tendencies than in Figure \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results_over_y}: lower fluxes and larger droplets for the low $We$ case.

%\section{Sources of uncertainty in PDA measurements}
\section{Uncertainty in experimental data}
\label{sec:jicf_dlr_experimental_uncertainty}

The experimental results previously shown, obtained by \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002], were obtained through PDA measurements. PDA is one of the most popular experimental techniques to characterize sprays, since it is non-intrusive and provies information on droplets size and velocities which can then be used to also estimate fluxes. It is not, however, exempt of errors, since it is built on the assumption that droplets are spherical and it is well known that PDA measurements yield considerable erros on droplets sizes and fluxes \citepColor[tropea_optical_2011]. Several sources of error have been identified in the past. \citeColor[bachalo_method_1980] explained that optics play a paramount role: the optical setup can lead to detection errors produced by phenomena associated to the misalignment of dual-beam reflected and refracted rays (Gaussian beam Effect) or to the well-known slit effect, which is cause a truncation on the measurement volume through a slit placed so that the droplet volumes to measure can be defined \citepColor[doublet_effet_2019]. Not associated to the actual setup, modifications in the refractive indices of droplets could affect the scattering and yield important errors in particle sizes, specially relevant in multicomponent fuels such as kerosene. The role of the droplet non-sphericity was discussed, stating that PDA is prone to size overestimation when particles are deformed or oscillate in a preferential direction, as also discussed by \citeColor[damaschke_optical_1998]. \citeColor[dullenkopf_comparative_1998] performed PDA measurements on two injectors, a pressure-swirl and an airblast atomizer, and quantified the errors in mass flux by comparing with the results obtained from a patternator. They identified three main sources of error in the flux estimation: the size measurement (which is powered to 3 to calculate the flux, hence increasing exponentially the flux errors), the number count of droplets and the reference area used for measurements (the smaller the area the better, since it can also avoid counting droplets twice). They found that the flux errors on the pressure swirl fluxes were of the order of 10 $\%$, while in the airblast configurations these increased up to 30 $\%$, and also showed that the SMDs could vary up to 30 $\%$ depending on the PDA system used. \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1998] tested an airblast configuration and discussed several possible sources of error in sizes, highlighting the contribution of alignment uncertainties in the setup ($\sim 1~\%$) the change in refractive indices due to heating ($\sim 3.5~\%$) and to deformation of the sampled particles, since accelerated droplets at high velocity environments will be elliptical rather than spherical and the droplets sizes would be overestimated, propagating later the error to the fluxes calculations (this would explain the larger errors found by \citeColor[dullenkopf_comparative_1998] in their airblast atomizer with respect to the pressure-swirl one). In total, uncertainty on dropsizes was quantified to be of 7 $\%$ while the error on fluxes added up to 10 $\%$ if the particles concentration was not too high. It is worth to remark that the test bench of \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1998] is the same one that \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] used later at DLR to test the liquid kerosene JICF dealt in this theses (even though the atomizer and the operating conditions are different, the PDA systems and optical configurations are equivalent). The experiments from \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] do not actually provide data on the dropsize uncertainties, but do discuss the errors on mass fluxes and report mean deviations of 20 $\%$ and maximum of 37 $\%$. A posterior study on this configuration was done by \citeColor[becker_experimental_2004], who tested a swirled injector and reported errors on the SMD of $\sim 5 \%$ (no data on fluxes) attributed to optical misalignment and hardware setting. \citeColor[tropea_optical_2011] makes a review on experimental methods involving optical techniques to characterize disperse multiphase flows, and states that PDA measurements often show uncertainted in flux measurements from $20~\%$ up to several hundrers, while errors in particle size often range, in ideal conditions, from 10 to 30 $\%$. 

The objective here is to estimate possible errors in the experimental measurements of \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results} to obtain confidence intervals for validation of numerical results. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, this study gives a mean uncertainty of 20 $\%$ in the fluxes but does not provide data on the diameters. For the same test bench but with different atomizers and operating conditions, \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1998] reports 7 $\%$ and 14 $\%$ of errors for the droplets diameters and fluxes, respectively, while \citeColor[becker_experimental_2004] give SMD uncertainties of $\sim 5 \%$. Even though the PDA setup is identical in the three studies, the provided errors differ among each other, which might be due to the operating conditions, the atomizer or modifications in the optical setup (indeed, \citeColor[doublet_effet_2019] showed through a error propagation analysis that the uncertainties in the diameters were actually spetially sensitive to the elevation angle of the PDA detectors rather than to other parameters). Therefore, in order to estimate the uncertainty of the diameters in the the experimental setup of \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002], it will be assumed that the relation between the dropsizes and fluxes errors is similar as in the study performed in the same testbench (and in similar operating conditions) by \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1998]: errors between fluxes and diameters differ by a factor of 2, which in case of \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] yields diameter uncertainties of 10 $\%$ since their mean uncertainty for the fluxes is of 20 $\%$. It is important to keep in mind that this estimated error in droplets size is only approximative and could greatly vary in the actual experiments. \\ %Generally, as shown by the previous literature review,  errors in PDA measurements on droplets sizes are not often reported and characteristic 

Since \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] give values on the flux uncertainties and their experimental data are available, it is possible to estimate the fluxes obtained from the experiments. The flux map ax $x = 80$ mm for the high Weber operating condition together with the grid composed of the probes through which the spray has been sampled is shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_previous_numerical_results}a. Square probes with 2 mm sides are placed as shown in the figure. Each probe contains a volume flux value $q_l$ which is stored at the center of the probe to plot the maps (as done in the SLI injectors of Figures 
\ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG75_dx10_x05} to \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx20_x10_NT}). The grid is then composed of $N_y = 11$ probes in the lateral direction and $N_z = 9$ in the vertical one. Given an arbitrary probe located at a position $\left( j,k \right)$ (where $j$ is the probe index in the lateral direction $y$ and $k$ in the vertical one $z$) with surface $S_\mathrm{j,j}$, the absolute liquid flux through this probe can be calculated by applying Eq. (\ref{eq:ch4_volume_flux_definition}) to the probe volume flux $q_{l{j,k}}$:

\begin{equation}
Q_{l_{j,k}} = q_{l_{j,k}} S_{j,k}
\end{equation}

Then, the total liquid flow rate from the map can be calcuated by adding all the absolute fluxes from each probe:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ch6_Ql_total_estimation_from_flux_profiles}
Q_{l} = \sum_{j=1}^{N_y} \sum_{k=1}^{N_z} Q_{l_{j,k}} = \sum_{j=1}^{N_y} \sum_{k=1}^{N_z} q_{l_{j,k}} S_{j,k} = 4062 ~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}
\end{equation}

which, as shown, gives a value of $4062 ~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The injected flow rate for this case is $Q_{l,\mathrm{inj}} = 3710~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as given in Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}. Therefore, the PDA measurements report a flux excess with respect to the injected flow rate of $9.5~\%$. This deviation is comprised within the mean uncertainty of $20~\%$ provided by the authors of the experiments. Nevertheless, it is paramount to consider this flux overestimation when comparing with the dispersed-phase simulations performed with SLI, since the liquid rates injected in these ones do not correspond to the experimental flux of $4062 ~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ but to the injected one of $Q_{l,\mathrm{inj}} = 3710~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In reality, if the PDA was exempt of errors (which, as explained previously, is never the case), the retrieved experimental flux could not be larger than the injected one as mass is not created in the simulation: and actually, it should be lower since there is filming in the experiments, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_snapshot_expe_filming}, that reduces the liquid flux perpendicular to the crossflow. The resolved simulations could capture this filming phenomenon in the jet, and the filming flux was quantified in $\S$\ref{sec:ch5_direct_measurement_fluxes_IB}.

Prior to this work, several authors have performed dispersed-phase simulations on the experimental configuration of \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002]. All cases simulated the high Weber operating point from Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}. \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] simulated the jet in steady crossflow by considering the early liquid as a cylinder deflected by the airflow, which exchanges momentum with a modified drag coefficient, sheds mass and produces droplets whose properties are given from experimental correlations. Later on, \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] extended this model to account for shear breakup of ellipsoids and flattened liquid jets (to account for more realistic JICF dense core effects) in both steady and unsteady crossflows, by using semi-empirical correlations. Independently of these studies, \citeColor[jaegle_large_2009] and \citeColor[senoner_simulation_2010] also developed models with this configuration: the former injected a developed spray at the liquid nozzle while accounting for a modified drag law in the near-nozzle region to mimic the liquid column momentum exchange, and the later injected big blobs at the nozzle but accounting for secondary atomization. All these models (except for
\citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] since it was more recently improved by \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016]) are summarized in the diagram of Figure \ref{ch3:subsec_lagrangian_liquid_JICF} and detailed in $\S$\ref{fig:state_art_injection}.

In order to position the current work into the state of the art, it is worth to compare it to the previous studies performed. All the works aforementioned use data shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_Becker_expe_results} to validate the computations. Nevertheless, not all the numerical studies previously mentioned use all these data for validation, but only display a few of them. Table \ref{tab:previous_numerical_studies_on_jicf_dlr_recap} shows a summary of the validation data directly available in the previous works. None of the papers referred present data on the SMD map, while only \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] give data on the global SMD obtained. Most of the works give data on the flux and SMD profiles integrated over $y$, while only \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] provides profiles integrated over $y$. %The only work which does not provide data on SMD distributions is \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016]. 

In first place, the flux maps from all the previous works that provide these information are shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_previous_numerical_results}. The experimental map is also show for visual comparison. In general, all maps show a circular flux shape and an overestimation of the maximum flux location in the vertical direction (the integrated maps discussed in the following lines confirm this observation). Since the data belonging to the the maps of the numerical studies were unfortunately not directly available, it was obtained by digitalizing the 2D maps depicted in the papers. The grid used for digitalizion is not shown since it was finer than the experimental grid in order to properly capture all the features of the maps, and showing it together with the maps hinders their visualization. From the digitalized maps, the total flux in the plane can be calculated as done previously for the experimental data applying Eq. (\ref{eq:ch6_Ql_total_estimation_from_flux_profiles}). The results are shown in Table \ref{tab:previous_numerical_studies_on_jicf_dlr_values}: even though the fluxes are not exactly equal to the injected flux (the digitalization methodology is not robust enough to retrieve accurately the actual fluxes plotted by the authors, which should be equal to the injected flux and therefore differ from the values obtained), all values are lower than the flux integrated from the experimental map. The only exception is \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002]: in fact, this work does not display neither maps nor absolute rates, but normalized integrated profiles which in this case have been de-normalized with the injected flux (it has been assumed that the flux retrieved at 80 mm is equal to the injected one). The integrated profiles of the fluxes shown in Figure \ref{fig:previous_works_profiles_comparison_with_expe} confirm these lower flow rates obtained in all simulations performed by each author. These integrated profiles have been obtained through either direct digitalization of the curves when available (Table \ref{tab:previous_numerical_studies_on_jicf_dlr_recap}) or by applying Eq. (\ref{eq:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}) to the maps when not available. The error bars in the experimental flux profiles of Figure \ref{fig:previous_works_profiles_comparison_with_expe} correspond to a deviation of 20 $\%$ in each point.

\end{figure}

As previously mentioned, none of the previous works display SMD maps. Most of the works report, on the other hand, $SMD$ integrated profiles over $y$: these have been digitalized and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:previous_works_profiles_comparison_with_expe}.   The error bars in the experimental SMD profiles at this Figure correspond to a deviation of 10 $\%$ in each point. All cases show a ballistic behaviour in which the SMD increases with vertical distance $z$. The SMD profiles integrate over $z$ are only present in \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002], who obtained accurate results at the center of the spray (region of maximum flux location) and showed a SMD overestimation when moving away towards the edges.

From the SMD integrated profiles over $y$, a global SMD can be estimated by performing a further integration along the $z$ direction:

\begin{equation}
 SMD =  \frac{1}{ \int_0^{L_z} \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle dz} \int_0^{L_z} \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle \langle SMD \left( z \right) \rangle dz
\end{equation}


Results are shown in Table \ref{tab:previous_numerical_studies_on_jicf_dlr_values}.  \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] do not provide the integrated SMD profile, yet they give directly the global SMD. Generally, all SMDs show a good agreement with respect to the experimental value of \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002]. The works of \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] and \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] perform a calibration of their model to match the experimental size distribution, hence such a good agreement is expected. Similar is the case of \citeColor[jaegle_large_2009], who already injected the experimental size distribution at the injector without including any secondary atomization model: then, the flux-weighted SMD is expected to be close to the SMD of this distribution. \citeColor[senoner_simulation_2010] does not inject any distribution but injects droplets at the liquid nozzle with size equal to the nozzle's diameter, drags them with a modified momentum transfer law at the column liquid region and then applies the stochastic secondary breakup model of \citeColor[gorokhovski_stochastic_2001], used in this thesis and explained in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch4_goro_model}, to account for further breakup of droplets. The good results in terms of global SMD and integrated profiles obtained in his work denote the suitabitliy of the stochastic breakup model to simulate such configurations.



%\citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002], who performed the first computations on this experimental bench, stated that the injected fuel flow rate is not conserved in the measurements at $x = 80$ mm since "\textsl{PDA measurements are less accurate at high local liquid fluxes because of dense spray effects} (sic)". \hl{...} The experimental volume flux map at $x = 80$ together with the grid in whose center the measurement probes have been located is shown in Figure \hl{\textbf{XX}} left. For each discrete probe ($j,k$), the absolute flux $Q_{l_{j,k}}$ can be calculated as:

\section{Obtention of boundary conditions for gaseous phase}
\label{sec:ch6_BC_gaseous_phase}

Prior to liquid injection, it is necessary to establish an initial solution for the gaseous phase as done for the resolved simulations. The difference with respect to the resolved simulations is that in this case, the initial solutions needs to consider the ALM since the dense core blockage effect needs to be modelled in the dispersed phase simulations. All the details of the model were addressed in $\S$\ref{sec:ch4_dense_core_modelling}. In this section, results from the resolved simulations are employed as input parameters to feed the ALM model. It is shown that the initial parameters do not capture correctly the gaseous turbulent structures, and are tuned in order to find an optimal configuration that better retrieves them. This optimal configuration is nevertheless not able to capture all the gaseous features, and another methodology to prescribe inlet boundary conditions obtained from the resolved atomization simulations in a reduced computational domain.


\subsection{Actuator Line Model}

%\subsection{Setup of actuator model}

An actuator representing the dense core can be defined for performing the dispersed-phase simulations by using results from the resolved atomization simulations as input parameters to ALM, whose control variables were summarized in Table \ref{tab:alm_parameters}. An example of an actuator representing the dense core in gaseous simulations can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:u_inst_SPS_and_ALM}. As observed, it is graphically represented as a cylinder with the initial point located in the injection nozzle exit and final point in the breakup location of the resolved dense core estimated from the resolved simulations. The actuator points (not shown in the figure) are located uniformly along the central line of the cylinder. The discrete forces applied to each point are then mollified in the neighbouring cells in order to avoid flow singularities.


\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption[Perturbation effect towards the gaseous phase visualized through the instantaneous velocity magnitude in the plane $y = 0$]{Perturbation effect towards the gaseous phase visualized through the instantaneous velocity magnitude in the plane $y = 0$. The snapshots correspond to the resolved simulation UG100\_DX10 (\textsl{left}) and to a gaseous simulation with the optimal actuator (\textsl{right})}	
	\label{fig:u_inst_SPS_and_ALM}
\end{figure}


In order to assess the ALM, the results from the high Weber operating point for the fine case (UG100\_DX10) are used: the actuator point coordinates $x_b$, $z_b$ are obtained from the mean values of Figure \ref{fig:dense_core_mean_parameters_scatterplots}, while the force $\textbf{F}_\mathrm{DC}$ is taken from Table \ref{tab:dense_core_pressures_and_force_parameters}. These values, summarized in Table \ref{tab:jicf_lgs_ALM_parameters}, represent an \textbf{initial} actuator. As it will be shown, it was found that the disturbance effect created by this actuator was not optimal to represent the disturbance effect of the dense core. Thus, the ALM control variables were tuned until finding an actuator which was found to better match the perturbed gaseous field: this one is summarized as the \textbf{optimal} actuator from Table \ref{tab:jicf_lgs_ALM_parameters}. This ALM configuration was chosen to be the optimal since it provides the best results with ALM on the dispersed-phase when compared to the experimental results on the spray ($\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_gaseous_phase_effect}). Apart from this optimal actuator, two other configurations are also reported to illustrate the influence of the parameters: one in which the actuator ending point is changed to the location of the optimal configuration while keeping the force of the initial one (\textbf{ALM tilted}), and another one in which the optimal ending point is kept but the net force is increased (\textbf{ALM forced}).

	\label{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_Y}
\end{figure}


In first place, the mean axial velocity fields in the symmetry plane $y = 0$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_Y}. The resolved case UG100\_DX10 is also displayed for comparison.  As observed, the initial actuator model creates only a slight perturbation downstream the cylinder location, but cannot properly retrieve the recirculation and deceleration regions which were captured by the resolved simulation. By changing only the actuator coordinates (tilted configuration), the perturbation effect is intensified and more distributed in space, since the angle $\theta$ increases and the imposed drag force is increased while the lift is reduced (Eqs. (\ref{eq:ALM_SLI_lift_drag_definitions})). This increase of the axial perturbation with changing coordinates is also reflected in the profiles of Figures \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_ALM_lines_y0_along_z_ux_mean} and \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_x}, which show the mean axial velocity along the lines plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_Y}: the tilted profile shows a slighly larger deviation when compared to the initial one, even though its perturbation is not yet close to the resolved profile. Indeed, the lift force imposed is not large enough and the streamlines do not deviate towards the vertical direction as in the resolved case, staying oriented towards the crossflow direction as in the unperturbed case. If the force is increased (optimal configuration), the velocity field from Figure \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_Y} shows a noticeable decrease in the axial velocity downstream the ALM region, with an increase also in the lift force as in this case streamlines are deviated upwards. The velocity profiles from Figures \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_ALM_lines_y0_along_z_ux_mean} and \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_x} show this greater perturbation when compared to the previous cases. Nevertheless, the disturbance is still not strong enough to capture the recirculation bubble which is observed in the resolved simulation. A further increase in the net force imposed (forced configuration) shows effectively a larger perturbation which can actually capture a recirculation bubble behind the ALM region, even its location is shifted upwards with respect to the bubble from the resolved case. The profiles from Figures \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_ALM_lines_y0_along_z_ux_mean} and \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_x} reflect this larger perturbation through the velocity profiles. However, even if the force configuration case seems to better the resolved perturbed field since it recovers the recirculation bubble, its stronger perturbation was found to greatly affect secondary atomization of the droplets in dispersed-phase simulations, yielding smaller droplets. Therefore, the reported optimal configuration is chosen as the actual optimal since it produced the best spray results among all the ALM cases. Forces in between the ones corresponding to the optimal and forced configurations were also tested (not reported here), without improving the dispersed-phase results with respect to the optimal one.

\end{figure}

Since the purpose of ALM is trying to capture the gaseous perturbations of the dense core as close as possible, it is also of interest to look at the planes perpendicular to the crossflow. Figure \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_x} shows the mean velocity fields at planes $x = 5, 10$ mm compared to the resolved cases. In the same was as in plane $y = 0$, modifying the actuator ending coordinates and increasing the net dense core reduced further the mean velocities in the flow field. This has also a strong effect in the counter-rotating vortices (CRVs) of the flow, which are an important characteristic of the JICF that can affect the transport and atomization of the droplets. Cases unperturbed and ALM initial do not show CRVs in the flow as shown by the flow streamlines, while the ALM tilted and optimal cases can retrieve quite accurately the location,  intensity and rotation direction of the resolved vortices. Further increasing the net force shows still vortical structures, yet these are small and differ from the shape of the resolved ones. In fact, a further increase in the force (not reported here) was also checked and showed that the CRVs inverted their rotation direction, which is an unphysical behaviour in the JICF \citepColor[karagozian_analytical_1986].


\begin{figure}[h!]

Finally, the velocity profiles along the white lines from Figure \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_x} are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_ALM_lines_iso-x_along_y_ux_mean}. Again, the initial and tilted ALM do not create a noticeable disturbance in the flow field compared to the resolved case, except at $z = 1.6$ mm in plane $x = 10$ mm where the tilted case shows the closest match of all models. Increasing the force approaches the resolved perturbation at plane $x = 5$ mm: the optimal ALM shows a good match at $z = 1.6$ mm, while the equivalent occurs for the force ALM further away from the wall at $z = 5$ mm. For the profiles at $z = 5$ mm in plane $x = 10$ mm, none of the actuators could achieve the intensity of the resolved perturbation: ALM creates the greatest perturbations downstream the actuator region but has a very limited influence further vertically from its ending point, which is not the case of a resolved dense core since the ligaments created during primary atomization also create perturbations in the gas field away from the dense core.

In general, it can be concluded that ALM can  perturb the gaseous field through the application of body forces but with a limited influence due to its simplified geometry, which cannot properly retrieve the complex topology of the dense core. The actuator model parameters have been tuned by a trial-and-error process to find an optimal configuration based on the ALM effect in the sprays fields, which are later analyzed in $\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_gaseous_phase_effect}. A better methodology to find optimal configuration for ALM would be through a multivariable optimization process which explores the ALM parameters to better represent the resolved gaseous field through the minimization of an objective function. Furthermore, improvements in the model could also include modifications in the ALM geometry such as the inclusion of several actuator models, of the inclusion of frequential effects which can better represent the dense core unsteady shape. Such strategies were out of the scope of this thesis and are left for future work. 


\subsection{Prescription of gaseous inlet from resolved simulations }
\label{subsec:ch6_jicf_lgs_gaseous_inlet_prescription}



%\subsubsection*{Methodology}


As previously shown, the ALM model has been proved to be able to perturb the gaseous field. From an initial actuator obtained with input parameters from the resolved atomization simulation, the ALM variables have been tuned to seek for a better match of the mean velocity profiles. This match, however, is not totally accurate and the perturbation effect from the resolved simulations cannot be fully captured with ALM, since the dynamics and topology of the liquid dense core cannot be properly represented with the proposed actuator parameters. 

With the objective of trying to improve the matching of the resolvded gaseous fields, an alternative to ALM is proposed in this section. This one is based on obtaining the gaseous field in a plane perpendicular to the crossflow from the resolved simulations. The field is characterized by the mean and RMS values of the velocities in the three directions. Such profiles are then imposed in a reduced domain consisting of a box with length $150$ mm and cross-section 25x40 mm$^2$ representing the downstream part of the plenum from the JICF configuration of Figure \ref{fig:numerical_setup_maquette_JICF_DLR}. A schematic of the methodology is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:custom_inlet_methodology}. The velocity profiles are imposed at the inlet of the prescribed domain according to the following law:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:prescribed_inlet_u_gas_injection_law}
\textbf{u} \left( \textbf{x}, t \right) = \overline{\textbf{u}} \left( \textbf{x} \right)  + r \left( t \right)  \textbf{u}_\mathrm{RMS} \left( \textbf{x} \right) 
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\textbf{u}} \left( \textbf{x} \right)$ and $\textbf{u}_\mathrm{RMS} \left( \textbf{x} \right)$ are the mean and RMS velocity distributions in the crossflow plane extracted from the resolved atomization simulations. $r \left( t \right)$ is a time-varying scalar sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1: $r \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1 \right)$. This velocity prescription law, which is based on the weak recycling method of synthetic turbulence injection by \citeColor[wu_large_1995], ensures that the injected $TKE$ in the dispersed phase simulations is the same as the one retrieved from the resolved atomization ones. %\hl{Nevertheless, due to the coarser mesh employed in the reduced domain with respect to the }

\end{figure}

The mesh employed for performing simulations with the prescribed inlet is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_reduced_inlet}. The mesh, which contains $12 \cdot 10^6$ elements, has been refined up to a location $x = 40$ mm downstream the inlet to a mesh size $\Delta x = 0.3$ mm, while from $x = 40$ mm up to $x = 100$ mm, the mesh size has been set to $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm as in the mesh of Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh_LGS}. The finer cell size of $\Delta x = 0.3$ mm has been selected  with the objective of better capturing the turbulent structures created by the inhomogeneous gaseous velocity profile injected. Nevertheless, this cell size is not resolved enough to capture those: in the resolved simulations of Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}, the cell size in the gaseous field around the liquid regions was of the order of the interface cell sizes ($20, 10~\mu$m) created by the ALM method, while such resolutions cannot be imposed into this reduced domain as the mesh size greatly increases and yields computations considerably expensive. Furthermore, a too fine mesh would create large volume fractions which are not in accordance with the application of lagrangian methods to simulate dispersed multiphase flows, which are applicable to small volume fractions \citepColor[murrone_numerical_2011].

%\subsubsection{Setup and results}

The injected in-plane profiles, shown in the maps of Figure \ref{fig:custom_inlet_methodology} for case UG100\_DX10, have been obtained at the location $x = 3$ mm downstream the liquid injection nozzle in the resolved atomization simulations. Other plane locations have been tested without observing significant differences in the dispersed-phase simulations, hence all results reported with this configuration include. In fact, the range of the possible planes to retrieve gaseous data for prescribing inlet BCs is narrow: upstream $x = 3$ mm the jet dense core is present and mean gaseous profiles would contain velocities corresponding to the liquid phase, while further downstream the lagrangian spray is injected in the dispersed-phase simulations (the earliest injection location is $x = 5$ mm). Hence, the only reported case here corresponds to the location $x = 3$ mm. Since the computational domain is reduced with respect to the full computational configuration used for the ALM, the axial coordinates are shifted 3 mm and the experimental validation plane, located at 80 mm downstream the liquid injection nozzle in the test bench, corresponds to the location $x = 77$ mm as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_reduced_inlet}. From now on, however, all axial coordinates reported will be expressed in the absolute reference frame of the experimental test bench for easening comparison with the ALM dispersed-phase simulations. This methodology will be referred as \textbf{prescribed gaseous inlet}.

Figure \ref{fig:custom_gas_fields_plane_Y} shows the mean axial velocity at plane $y = 0$ mm. Both the resolved atomization simulation UG100\_DX10 and the prescribed gaseous are shown: the former shows the field up to the location $x = 3$ mm (prescription plane), then the gaseous field corresponds to the prescribed gaseous inlet. The velocity field shows good continuity among simulations at the prescription plane, indicating that the resolved field is correctly prescribed in the gaseous simulation. The perturbation created by the prescribed simulation is very close to the resolved simulation at vertical locations $z < 4$ mm, as shown by the profiles along the white lines plotted in Figures \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_custom_lines_y0_along_x_ux_mean} and \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_custom_lines_y0_along_z_ux_mean}. For locations further from the wall ($z > 4$ mm), the prescribed simulation does not capture correctly the resolved perturbation and deviations in the velocity profiles increase, with the prescribed profiles approaching the ones from the ALM optimal (also shown for comparison) at Figures \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_custom_lines_y0_along_x_ux_mean} right and  \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_custom_lines_y0_along_z_ux_mean}. In the resolved simulations, the perturbations far away from the wall are created by ligaments ejected from the dense core: these ones contain large volumes of liquid and exchange momentum with the gaseous field along the jet trajectory until they disintegrate into small droplets, which can occur up to several diameters downstream the liquid injection location (see for instance Figure \ref{fig:jicf_sps_with_gaseous_planes} for a visualization of ligaments in case UG100\_DX10, which are present up to $x = 5$ mm). In the prescribed simulation, gaseous statistics are specified at $x = 3$ mm and there is no liquid present to perturb the gaseous field as ligaments do in the resolved simulations, hence such disturbances are not captured. As commented before, changing the location of the gaseous inlet at further upstream or downstream (prior to $x = 5$ mm, since lagrangian droplets will be injected at this location) had no influence on the gaseous field.

The flow field at planes perpendicular to crossflow direction $x = 5, 10$ mm  are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:custom_gas_fields_plane_x}. The prescribed gaseous inlet can retrieve the CRVs spinning directions in both cases. At $x = 5$ mm the vertical location of the CRV is underestimated with respect to the resolved case, while further downstream it gets closer. The velocity profiles along the white lines are shown in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_custom_lines_iso-x_along_y_ux_mean}.  Closer to the wall ($z = 1.6$ mm), the prescribed inlet profile coincides with the resolved one in all the range except for the local minima captured at both sides close to $y = 0$, which are not present in the resolved case. Further from the wall ($z = 5$ mm) the prescribed profile does not match the resolved profile due to the reasons aforementioned, and creates flow decelerations with magnitudes similar to the ALM optimal case.

In general, it can be concluded that the prescribed inlet captures more accurately than the ALM tested, furthermore with lower computational cost since it represents only a portion of the original computational domain. On the contrary, the disadvantage of the prescribed inlet strategy is that it can be a priori performed in simple geometries such as the academic JICF tested.

\section{Liquid boundary conditions}
\label{sec:JICf_LGS_liquid_BCs}

The boundary conditions to initialiwe lagrangian droplets are given by the SLIs obtained from the resolved atomization simulations in the previous chapter, represented by the maps from $\S$\ref{sec:ch5_learning_SLI}: these ones will impose the particles size, velocity and the mass flux within each injection probe from the SLI. In particular, the prescription of droplets velocities needs to be accurately specified since, as discussed in $\S$\ref{subsec:SPS_inhomogeneity_sprays}, the sampled spray show a high dispersion in the velocities. For taking this feature into account, droplets are then injected according to their mean value plus a random component which depends on the RMS of the spray (Eq. \ref{eq:ch4_lagrangian_injection_velocity_with_mean_and_rms}).  All lagrangian simulations reported in this chapter will consider this RMS component, unless otherwise specified. An example of RMS maps for the SLI of case UG100\_DX10 at $x = 5$ mm is shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_SLI_with_RMS}. As observed, the most noticeable changes correspond to regions

As observed in the Figure \ref{fig:maps_SLI_with_RMS}, all velocities specified are volume-weighted (VW) within each probe. Indeed, all lagrangian simulations reported in this chapter will prescribe volume-weighted velocities, unless otherwise specified. It is therefore interesting to show the difference among mean arithmetic and VW velocities, which is done by comparing the maps corresponding to both magnitudes in Figure \ref{fig:maps_SLI_with_arithmetic_mean_and_VW}. As observed, the largest differences are located in the central and top parts of the maps, which are respectively the regions with larger flux and with larger droplets. The maps for the axial and vertical velocities are the ones showing more differences: in general, the volume-weighted velocities are lower with respect to the arithmetic ones, which will affect secondary atomization since it modifies the relative liquid-gas velocity. For the vertical velocity map, this could also affect the penetration of the spray. The vertical velocity maps do not show significant differences, appart from a wider central region where velocity varies from $-6$ to $4$ m/s.

Finally, the effect of obtaining SLIs through the convergence-driven discretization strategy is assessed. For this purpose, the quadtrees refinement strategy presented in $\S$\ref{subsec:SLI_quadtrees_discretization} has been applied to the spray obtained for case UG100\_DX10 at $x_\mathrm{inj} = 5$ mm. Three levels of refinement have been performed. The resulting SLI is shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_SLI_with_quadtrees}, where the ad-hoc SLI for the same case is also added for comparison. It is directly observed how the convergence-driven discretization acts in order to preserve a fully converged spray in all the spatial domain.

\section{Procedure for setting dispersed-phase simulations}

In Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}, the five resolved atomization simulations from Table \ref{fig:location_JICF_ops_in_breakup_map} were performed and analyzed. These ones tested two mesh interface mesh resolutions ($\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 20, 10~\mu$m) and two operating points ($We_g = 830, 1470$). Results shown a high dependency of the trajectories ($\S$\ref{subsec:ch5_jet_trajectories_results}) and jet topologies ($\S$\ref{sec:ch5_jet_evolution}) on the resolution, which led later to different spray characteristics ($\S$\ref{sec:ch5_sec_spray_characterization}) and resulting injectors ($\S$\ref{sec:ch5_learning_SLI}). Therefore, it is of interest to test such effects in the disperse-phase simulations by initializing these computations with the different injectors obtained.

Figure \ref{fig:dispersed_phase_sli_parameters} shows the different models involved in the dispersed phase simulations with their control parameters: they are split into the possible influences on the gas and liquid phases, as well as the secondary breakup which is considered as an interaction between both (even though it acts on the liquid phase, it needs the gas velocity for calculating the relative velocity in order to estimate liquid breakup). In this section, all the parameters from the SLI model in the JICF case are analyzed: a baseline configuration is chosen, which was found to be the most optimal one yielding the best match to the experimental results, and then each SLI parameter is modified individually. The baseline configuration consists of the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}

	\item The \textbf{gaseous phase} is provided by the \textbf{custom inlet} methodology. This one was found to better match the aerodynamic field from the resolved computation and produces a lagrangian spray closer to the experimental results, as demonstrated in $\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_gaseous_phase_effect}.
	
	\item \textbf{Secondary atomization model} is taken to be the Gorokhovski model with calibrated constants $K_1 = 0.05$, $K_2$ = 1. Calibration of the secondary model is reported in $\S$\ref{{subsec:second_atom_goro_calibration}}.
	
	\item \textbf{SLI} corresponds to the discretized spray obtained from the high Weber case at the finest resolution, UG100\_DX10, at location $x = 5$ mm. This case is chosen as the baseline one since 1) the operating point been previously studied by other authors and hence the results reported here can be easily compared ($\S$\ref{ch6:previous_numerical_studies}), 2) the finer interface cell size in the resolved simulation provides a better resolution of the sprays, and 3) the location closer to the injection point deviates less with respect to the experimental trajectory than the sampled spray further downstream (see Figure \ref{fig:JICF_trajectories_validation}). The effect of other operating conditions, resolved interface resolutions and injection locations is studied in $\S$\ref{subsec:SLI_LGS_resolution_and_injection_location},.

	\item \textbf{Droplets sizes} prescribed are randomly sampled from a lognormal distribution fitting the histogram in each individual probe. 
	
	\item The \textbf{operating condition} is also change by performing a dispersed-phase simulation for the low Weber case with the corresponding SLI obtained. These results are reported in $\S$\ref{subsec:JICF_LGS_params_OP}.

\end{itemize}






With the objective of testing all the parameters involved in the lagrangian computations, a design of experiments process is followed in which each variable is changed in a one-at-a-time basis. The study of dispersed-phase simulations in then divided into three parts, which are enclosed by the dashed-colored lines in Figure  \ref{fig:dispersed_phase_sli_parameters}:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item The \textbf{gas phase} effect is analyzed by injecting lagrangian droplets with the baseline injectors in the gaseous fields previously analyzed in $\S$\ref{sec:ch6_BC_gaseous_phase}. The results are discussed in $\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_gaseous_phase_effect}. In this section, the establishment of the liquid phase and time needed to convergence of mean parameters are also  included.
	
	\item The \textbf{secondary atomization models} are analyzed in $\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_secondary_breakup_models}. This section is divided into two parts: a first one in which the free constants of the Gorokhovski model are tuned, and a second one in which the three available. models are compared.
	
	\item Finally, the effects of the \textbf{liquid phase} parameters from SLI and operating conditions are reported in $\S$\ref{sec:effect_of_SLI_variables}. Besides the already introduced parameters, a last variable which consists of a spatial delay in which secondary atomization is not activated $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$ is also discussed.

\section{Influence of gas phase}
\label{sec:SLI_LGS_gaseous_phase_effect}

\subsection{Lagrangian jet establishment}

The establishment of the dispersed phase for cases ALM optimal and the prescribed inlet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_LGS_spray_establishment}. In both cases  the injection and experimental validation planes, $x = 5$ and $x = 80$ mm respetively, are shown, as well as the liquid injection region enclosed by the black outline in the injection plane. For the case with ALM, the actuator is represented by the denoted cylinder. The prescribed inlet simulation includes as well an instantaneous view of the resolved liquid jet from case UG100\_DX10 solely for visualization among resolved and lagrangian jets: resolved liquid is not actualy present in the dispersed-phase computations. The time instants are expressed in a dimensionless form with respect to the inertial timescale according to Eq. (\ref{eq:t_dimensionless_with_tau_in}).

In both simulations, lagrangian droplets are injected in the denoted liquid injection region (which represents the spatial bounds of the SLI from Figure \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx10_x05}) which are then convected downstream. Right after injection, the particles have a diameter of the order of the SMD from Figure \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx10_x05} and a finite vertical component velocity which is lower at the bottom of the injection plane and larger at its tope. As a consequence of this vertical velocity component, the jet's vertical trajectory continues to increase with axial distance. Shortly after injection, droplets are quickly atomized into smaller particles due to the action of the secondary breakup model. The liquid-gas relative velocity is large in all simulations, hence the breakup model estimates the atomization events to occur soon after injection and the size of the droplets is reduced very fast with axial distance. Indeed, the dispersed-phase simulations show a very abrupt decrease in SMD up to a location between $x = 15$ and $20$ mm, depending on the case: further downstream, the SMD in the prescribed gaseous inlet simulations stays constant while the ALM ones continue atomizing droplets at a slow pace. Downstream this location the dispersed spray is fully atomized and droplets are only convected. As a consequence of such a fast breakup, the smaller droplets generated have a lower relaxation time and are quickly dragged by the gaseous crossflow, increasing their axial velocity and reducing their vertical one, hence stopping penetrating in the vertical direction. 

Figure \ref{fig:JICF_LGS_spray_establishment} shows the secondary atomization of a single lagrangian droplet in case ALM initial. The displayed domain in each figure corresponds to the region enclosed by the red rectangle in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_LGS_spray_establishment}. Then, further zoomed views enclosed in blue show the droplets generated from the original droplet detected at the firstly displayed time instant. The original droplet at $t^* = 22.40$, with a diameter of 93 $\mu$m, breaks into several droplets of smaller size at $t^* = 23.02$ whose total volume contains the same mass as the original droplet. These children droplets have different sizes as a consequence of the statistical sampling from the cumulative distribution Eq. (\ref{eq:gorokhovski_T_CDF}). Particles are then convected and undergo a further breakup event at $t^* = 24.26$, producing a larger number of smaller children droplets, where the smallest diameter produced was 13 $\mu$m. This sequence of subsequent atomization events is referred as the breakup cascade mechanism \citepColor[tanner_simulation_1998]. In the particular snapshots shown, the original droplet prior to breakup at $t^* = 22.4$ is located at $x = 5.5$ mm (i.e. 0.5 mm further downstream the injection location), while the droplets at the last instant $t^* = 24.26$ are located at $x \sim 9$ mm. This indicates that the breakup cascade occurs soon after the injection process and gets completed shortly afterwards. For this particular breakup event, the cascade occurs within a region $\Delta x = 3.5$ mm in a timespan of $\Delta t^* = 1.86$, which corresponds to a physical timespan of $\Delta t = 0.036$ ms.

\subsection{Analysis of lagrangian spray}
\label{subsec:jicf_lgs_sed_gas_phase_influence_spray_analysis}

\subsubsection*{Spray establishment}

The resulting dispersed-phase sprays can be analyzed by tracking lagrangially the droplets when they cross planes perpendicular to the gaseous crossflow in the same way as performed in the resolved atomization simulations. The difference with respect to the latter is that each lagrangian droplet is identified with a unique tag that allows to detect if a lagrangian droplet has been previously sampled or not.  In this way, particles that might be tracked more than once with the detection algorithm are only accounted in the first time instant detected, hence avoiding repeated droplets when processing the spray. The only case in which this fails is if the atomization models triggers a breakup event when a parent droplet is crossing a sampling plane, since children droplets are given a new tag that fails in the detection of \textsl{repeated droplets} in such case.

Sprays have been sampled in planes perpendicular to the crossflow direction separated by a distance $\Delta x = 2$ mm from the injection location $x = 5$ mm up to the experimental sampling plane $x = 80$ mm, both shown in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_LGS_spray_establishment}. In order to study established sprays, the time that the first droplet takes to reach the experimental sampling plane $x = 80$ mm, hereafter referred as $\tau_\mathrm{dr_{x=80}}$, has been firstly obtained. Then, simulations have been run for a time $t \sim 2 \tau_\mathrm{dr_{x=80}}$ (establishment time) without lagrangian droplets tracking, and then tracking has been activated to start accumulating droplets and calculating statistics. The times $\tau_\mathrm{dr_{x=80}}$ for the gaseous simulations performed, as well as the physical and accumulation times, are summarized in Table \ref{tab:jicf_LGS_t_prime_accumulation}. The convergence of the global spray has then be assessed by monitoring the SMD and the flux $Q_l$ with respect to time, which is expressed in a dimensionless form with respect to $\tau_\mathrm{dr_{x=80}}$ as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t_prime_with_tau_drx80}
t^{\prime} = \frac{t}{\tau_\mathrm{dr_{x=80}}}
\end{equation}

	The evolution of flux and SMD at the plane $x = 80$ mm with time for the simulations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:LGS_QL_and_SMD_convergence_with_time}. The flux shows that all cases tend to wards the injected flow rate, with slight overestimations in some cases possibly due to some lagrangian particles being sampled twice. The SMD profiles show convergence in all cases, but towards different values which in the most extreme cases (prescribed inlet versus ALM forced) differ by a factor of 2. The evolution of SMD along the channel and the dependence of granulometry with the gaseous boundary conditions is analyzed next.

\subsubsection*{Spatial evolution of spray}

As shown in Figures \ref{fig:JICF_LGS_spray_establishment} and \ref{fig:JICF_LGS_breakup_cascade_in_ALM_figure}, secondary atomization acts shortly after droplets are injected by SLI. These droplets are injected at location $x = 5$ mm and are transported along the channel, being sampled at $x = 80$ mm for experimental comparison. The SMDs at this location are of the order of the values shown in Figure \ref{fig:LGS_QL_and_SMD_convergence_with_time}, while the injected droplets obtained from resolved simulation UG100\_DX10 have a global SMD of $80.2~\mu$m (Figure \ref{fig:ch5_spray_char_SMD_final}). This indicates a strong reduction of particles diameters due to secondary atomization. Therefore, it is of interest to see at which extent atomization acts along the channel. For this purpose, the evolution of $SMD$ with axial distance $x$ along the plenum is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_gaseous_BCs}. The $SMD$ from the resolved simulation UG100\_DX10 and the experimental one with the uncertainty estimated in $\S$\ref{sec:jicf_dlr_experimental_uncertainty} are also shown for comparison. As observed, the $SMD$ drops drastically shortly after injection up to $x \sim 20$ mm, then it continues decreasing in a linear way up to $x = 80$ mm. The abrupt decrease in diameter at early axial locations is exponential and shows a similar shape for all cases;  however, for the ALM cases, the decaying rate and the final $SMD$ varies. In general, the prescribed inlet provides the largest $SMD$ while the ALM cases result in lower values due to a worse replication of the resolved gaseous phase, thus mispredicting the relative velocity for the lagrangian droplets and affecting breakup. At $x = 10$ mm the deviation with the resolved case is large: 79.9 vs 23.9 $\mu$m for the prescribed inlet, which supposes a difference of 70 $\%$.  However, it is worth to remind that the resolved atomization simulation might not be fine enough to retrieve the smallest liquid scales that would be actually present as discussed in $\S$\ref{ch5:subsec_spray_char_granulo}, hence limiting the smallest droplets that can be resolved.

The linear region, which spans from $x = 20$ to $80$ mm, reduces the mean diameter slowly along the channel after the disminution in the exponenial region. This is specially noticeable for the cases with the full computational domain from the resolved simulation (with and without ALM), while in the prescribed gaseous inlet simulation the variation is so small that is not appreciated in the figure. For quantifying this variation, a decay rate $\lambda$ is calculated as the slope in the $SMD$-$x$ curve from $x =20$ mm to $x = 80$ mm:

\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{SMD_{x=20\mathrm{mm}} -  SMD_{x=80\mathrm{mm}}}{60}
\end{equation} 

Table \ref{tab:SMD_decay_rates} summarizes the obtained SMDs and decay rates for all cases. The values for $\lambda$ are of the same order for all ALM and the unperturbed cases, while it is more than one order of magnitude lower than for the prescribed gaseous inlet spray. The lower decay rate is associated to a more accurate resolution of the gaseous phase with the prescribed inlet (meaning that it matches better the perturbed field of the resolved atomization simulation), which can be seen for instance in the gaseous profiles of Figure \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_custom_lines_y0_along_x_ux_mean}. The decay rates for the ALM cases show similar orders of magnitude, yet the values also differ and affect the final SMDs obtained: the lowest value (which results in a higher final SMD) corresponds to the optimal case, while the highest decay rate has been obtained for the ALM forced. In general, the lower the decay rate (or in other words, the larger the final SMD), the better, since as observed in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_gaseous_BCs} the SMDs found in the simulations underestimate the experimental results.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Experimental comparison}

The sprays at $x = 80$ mm can be compared with the experimental results reported at the same locations. In first place, the global SMDs shown graphically in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_gaseous_BCs} are also summarized in Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_gaseous_inlet}, where where the error with respect to experiments $\varepsilon_{SMD}$ is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:error_expe_SMD_LGS_simus}
\varepsilon_{SMD} = \frac{SMD_\mathrm{simu} - SMD_\mathrm{expe}}{SMD_\mathrm{expe}}
\end{equation}

where $SMD_\mathrm{simu}$ and $SMD_\mathrm{expe}$ are the numerical and experimental SMDs at $x = 80$ mm respectively. As already discussed in the previous section, the gaseous prescribed inlet provides the better experimental match, while the ALM forced case provides the largest deviation. Among all actuator cases, the optimal ALM is the one giving the best experimental comparision, yet it is still worse than the prescribed inlet simulation. This demonstrates again the importance of properly retrieving the gaseous phase, since as seen graphically in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_gaseous_BCs} it has a strong impact in lagrangian particles breakup. In particular, secondary atomization is of high relevance in the case studied since the injected droplets, obtained through resolved atomization simulations, are larger than the experimental SMDs reported further downstream by \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002]. The secondary atomization is then strongly affected by the gaseous boundary conditions, since capturing accurately the velocity fields would allow to better approximating the relative velocities, which are one of the governing parameters of the secondary atomization models since they are related to the Weber number (criterion to decide if atomization occurs or not) by a power of 2.

The spray at $x = 80$ mm is then discretized to yield the spatial maps of SMD and flux in Figure \ref{fig:maps_LGS_JICF_gaseous_influence}. The experimental maps from Figure \ref{fig:maps_Becker_expe_results} are also displayed: the SMD scale has been changed in order to allow for a visual comparison with the simulation results. These spatial magnitudes can also be integrated in each direction with Eqs. (\ref{eq:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}) to yield the spatially integrated profiles of Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_gaseous_influence}.

Flux maps show an elliptical pattern which is more elongated along the vertical direction than along the lateral one, while experiments show a circular shape. The simulations show a larger concentration of droplets in the center, which is reflected in higher local maximum fluxes whose vertical location agrees fairly well with the experiments. The prescribed gaseous inlet simulation captures accurately this location, while the ALM ones underestimate it slightly, as it is also reflected in the vertical profiles of Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_gaseous_influence}. Some maximum local fluxes in the numerical maps are actually larger than the maximum retrieved by the experiments, while indeed the experiments overestimated the total flux with respect to the injected one (see $\S$\ref{sec:jicf_dlr_experimental_uncertainty}): the fact that larger local fluxes are obtained in the computations is due to the more elongated shape of the numerical sprays than in the experiments, which show a more circular pattern and therefore lower local fluxes. The numerical spray vertical boundaries, observed both in the maps and in the vertical flux profiles of Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_gaseous_influence}, show that these penetrate further than the experiments. Nevertheless, the overestimated upper boundary corresponds to areas with low liquid flux ($q_l < 0.5~\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s}$), which agrees with the location of larger SMDs and indicates that there are few large droplets with a more ballistic behaviour (due to a larger Stokes number) that still have a vertical velocity component and hence travel further away. Indeed, the boundaries for the regions with larger fluxes ($q_l > 0.5~\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s}$) are close to the same experimental boundaries. Similarly, the lateral boundaries show droplets up to the channel walls, although these regions (generally for $|y| > 6$ mm) contain low fluxes. The vertical boundaries where $q_l > 0.5~\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s}$ are located closer to the central plane than in the experiments, yielding the elliptical pattern in the computations. This might be caused by an underestimation of the lateral trajectory in the resolved atomization simulation, although this characteristic of the JICF has not been studied in this work and a definitive statement cannot be done. The flux profiles integrated along the lateral  direction $\left\langle q_l \right\rangle \left( y \right)$ shows good experimental agreement for $y < 0$ but underestimation of flux for $y > 0$, which might indicate that experiments overestimate the flux at this region. In general, it can be said that the dispersed-phase computations retrieve quantitatively the patterns of the flux with similar vertical boundaries although a small quantity of large droplets penetrating further away than in the experiments. Simulations also show vertical locations of the maximum fuel flux close to experiments: the prescribed case can accurately retrieve this location, while the ALM ones generally underestimate it.


The numerical SMD maps show layered profiles characteristic with droplets sizes increasing from the bottom to the top, which is the characteristic ballistic behaviour of JICF sprays. This ballistic profile is also constated by the increasing SMD along $z$ in the profiles from Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_gaseous_influence}. As also shown by the maps and the profiles, all cases underestimate the experimental values, which agrees with the previous discussions on the global granulometry of the sprays. The maps also reflect in most cases an increase in SMD towards the lateral edges, which is reflected in the SMD increase at the integrated profile $\left\langle SMD \right\rangle \left( y \right)$ in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_apte_calibration} right (convex profile). Such behaviour, which is not observed in experiments but was also retrieved numerically by \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] (Figure \ref{fig:previous_works_profiles_comparison_with_expe}), are caused by large droplets with large Stokes number that follow their own direction rather than being entrained by the flow, which reach the walls of the plenum and do not undergo further atomization. This lateral increase is clearly noticeable for the prescribed inlet simulation and less pronounced for the ALM ones: as secondary atomization acts faster for those, the larger droplets are quickly disintegrated and smaller droplets are obtained. Actually, the lateral profiles become flatter as the cases underestimate the SMDs, producing even a concave profile in the ALM forced simulation.

The analysis from this section has shown that the imposition of accurate boundary conditions for the gaseous phase is paramount for a proper modelling of JICF dispersed-phase simulations, as the gaseous flow field will affect the secondary atomization of the droplets through the liquid-gas relative velocity. The prescribed gaseous inlet methodology has found to retrieve more accurately the experimental results, and therefore it will be kept for the subsequent studies in this chapter.

\section{Influence of modelling secondary atomization}
\label{sec:SLI_LGS_secondary_breakup_models}

To consider the secondary breakup of lagrangian droplets in dispersed-phase simulations, three atomization models are available ($\S$\ref{sec:ch4_secondary_atomization_modeling}): TAB, ETAB and Gorokhovski. All these models estimate breakup according to the Weber based on the relative velocity, which is the known parameter to control secondary atomization. Then, the exact instant of breakup and the size and number of children droplets are calculated differently by each model. The TAB and ETAB models belong to the same family and provide fixed values for the parameters controlling the model, while the Gorokhovski's stochastic model presents two constants that can be calibrated by the user. Therefore, firstly the Gorokhovski's stochastic model is calibrated in order to better match the experimental results.  Then, the best configuration obtained is compared to the results from the TAB and ETAB models. It is found that these models provide good results in terms of flux distribution but that all underestimate the droplets sizes after atomization, while in the Gorokhovski model the two control variables can be tuner in order to get a better tradeoff between the droplets sizes and fluxes distribution.

\subsection{Calibration of Gorokhovski model}
\label{subsec:second_atom_goro_calibration}

The Gorokhovski stochatic model, described in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch4_goro_model}, presents two free constants $K_1$ and $K_2$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:gorokhovski_epsilon_parameters_definition}) which can be tuned for each particular case and which affect the size of the children droplets produced.  $K_1$ affects the mean value of the generated children particles a breakup event, while $K_2$ controls the deviation from this mean \citepColor[senoner_simulation_2010]. The effect of both constants in the sprays have been investigated by selecting a baseline configuration with $K_1 = 0.05$, $K_2 = 1.0$ (such values provided the best experimental comparison obtained in terms of SMD) and varying both constants independently: first $K_1$ is increased to $0.1$ and $0.2$, and then $K_2$ is decreased to 0.5 and 0.25, making a total of five simulations reported.

Figure \ref{fig:maps_LGS_JICF_second_atom_apte_calibration} shows the SMD and flux maps at $x = 80$ mm, and the integrated profiles are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_apte_calibration}. The first two rows shows the effect of changing $K_1$, while the last two ones show the equivalent for $K_2$. All cases retrieve correctly the experimental location of the maximum fuel flux, with larger local fluxes found in the simulations, while the integrated profiles show however lower values than the experiments: this is due to the narrower (i.e. more elliptical) flux profiles from the simulations. Increasing $K_1$ creates a larger concentration of droplets, yielding a larger local maximum. Furthermore, increasing $K_1$ decreases the penetration of the spray as shown by the lower vertical boundary in case $K_1 = 0.2, K_1 = 1.0$ with compared to the others. This affects however only to the region with the lowest flux ($q_l < 0.5~\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s}$), which coresponds to the largest SMDs obtained: the top boundary of the region enclosed by $q_l > 0.5~\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{cm}^2\mathrm{s}$ is identical for all cases, agreeing fairly well with the same vertical boundary than the experiments. The integrated flux along the vertical direction $\left\langle q_l \right\rangle \left( z \right)$ reflects also this difference in penetration by the larger flux values for $z > 15$ mm in the computations when compared to experiments.  

With respect to the SMD results, the numerical maps show again layered profiles corresponding to a correct ballistic behaviour of the spray. All profiles of SMD with $y$ show in all cases a convex shape, with increasing SMD at the edges. The numerical sprays also show underestimation of the diameters with respect to the experiments for which the lowest diameters are found for case $K_1 = 0.05, K_2 = 0.25$ and the largest ones are obtained for $K_1 = 0.05, K_2 = 1.0$. Regarding the vertical boundaries, the profiles along $z$ show that increasing $K_2$ increases the vertical penetration while an augmentation of $K_1$ decreases it (as also observed in the maps). Yet, as previously discussed, these changes in vertical boundaries occur for the region with the lowest flux, while the zones with larger concentrations are invariant with the model constants. 
 
The influence of the Gorokhovski constants in the evolution of atomization along the channel are shown in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_breakup_model}. As in the previous case, there is an abrupt exponential decrease in SMD shortly after injection and stabilization towards $x \sim 20$ mm. For all cases, the SMD stays almost constant after this location, indicating that atomization has finished in its majority and there are only very few droplets being further atomized from this point which do not affect significantly the results. This confirms that evolution of secondary atomization is highly dependent on the gaseous phase modelling, and that the Gorokhovski model produces an atomized spray at similar locations for this JICF configuration (it is not the case for the rest of atomization models, which are discussed in the next section). In general, all simulations with the different calibration constants yield close values of SMD at $x = 80$ mm: these are shown in Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_turb_inj}, which that the experimental errors on $SMD$ are of the order of $40~\%$. The lowest error is obtained for $K_1 = 0.05, K_2 = 0.1$ ($37.05~\%$) and the largest one for $K_1 = 0.05, K_2 = 1.0$ ($46.45~\%$), indicating that it is the constant $K_2$ the one having a larger influence on the atomization. Since this constant affects the standard deviation of the children droplets produced, a larger $K_2$ produces particles with a wider range of possible diameters. In combination with the stochastic velocity component imposed according to Eq. (\ref{eq:ch4_lagrangian_injection_velocity_with_mean_and_rms}), the range of possible Weber numbers for children droplets is wider, resulting then in an atomization cascade that could trigger subsequent breakup events at later time instants, producing again larger droplets. This could also explain the lowest penetration for the case with smallest $K_2$: smaller droplets produced relax faster towards the crossflow direction, losing their vertical velocity component before larger droplets, and therefore being unable to penetrate further in the vertical direction.
In case such hypothesis were true, the results presented in this chapter could be improved by implementing the sectional approach discussed in $\S$\ref{subsec:SPS_inhomogeneity_sprays} which would prescribe to each droplet a velocity according to its size, hence yielding more realistic the secondary atomization of lagrangian droplets.

From this analysis, the constants $K_1 = 0.05$, $K_2 = 1.0$ have been chosen for performing the rest of the analysis since they yield the lowest error in SMD with respect to experiments. 

\subsection{Comparison of breakup models}

The TAB and ETAB breakup models are now compared to Gorokhovski's, for which the results with constants constants $K_1 = 0.05$, $K_2 = 1.0$ are shown. Firstly, the SMD and flux maps and profiles are displayed in Figures \ref{fig:maps_LGS_JICF_second_atom_models} and \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_secondary_atom_model} respectively for all cases. Both TAB and ETAB models show similar circular patterns for the fluxes. Spray from TAB model overpredicts the vertical maximum flux location, also condensing a large part of the spray in this region as shown by the larger local fluxes. The ETAB model, on the other hand, predicts this location accurately and shows a good spatial repartition of the spray, and also shows a good estimation of the spray vertical bounds as reflected both in the map and the integrated profile $\left\langle q_l \right\rangle \left( z \right)$. The SMD maps and profiles show a proper ballistic behaviour for both TAB and ETAB sprays but underestimation of the diameters, being those specially small for the TAB model. Underprediction of particles sizes by the TAB model is a known downcome of this model, and solventing this issue was the reason why the ETAB model was developed. Indeed, the figures show that the latter model produces larger droplets than the former: the SMDs at $x = 80$ mm, summarized in Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_turb_inj}, yield errors of $- 55.07~\%$ and $43.59~\%$ for the TAB and ETAB models respectively. The closest is then obtained for the Gorokhovski model with the calibrated constants. 

Evolution of the SMD along the channel is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_breakup_model}. The SMD shows also a sharp reduction close to injection, with a faster decay for the TAB than for the ETAB and Gorokhovski models. The models from the TAB family stabilize at $x \sim 15$ mm, earlier than Gorokhovski. From this graph, it is demonstrated that the earliest instants are crucial for the atomization process, since the lowests SMDs are always obtained for the largest decay rates close to injection (also observed in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_breakup_model}). Such abrupt decay rates very close to injection occur due to large relative velocities, as momentum exchange between the liquid and the gas has not occured yet. Momentum exchange is assessed later in $\S$\ref{sec:LGS_delay_secon_atom} by introducing an artificial delay from injection to the onset of atomization.

In general, it has been observed that the secondary atomization model has a great influence on this process, yet the models tested do not yield particles sizes within the range of experimental uncertainties estimated. The Gorokhovski model calibrated in the previous section has given the best agreement in terms of spray sizes. Nevertheless, these atomization models are general and have not been developed for particular conditions: the high pressure, highly turbulent environment found in the studied case might require atomization models more fitted to these conditions (indeed, both \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] and \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] employed an ad-hoc atomization model particular for this operating condition). Furthermore, this work has not considered the coalescence of lagrangian droplets, which in reality could produce larger diameters after the atomization process.

\section{Influence of SLI variables}
\label{sec:effect_of_SLI_variables}

In this section, the sensitivity of the dispersed-phase simulations to the parameters that can be prescribed with SLI is assessed. These parameters are summarized in the corresponding block of Figure \ref{fig:dispersed_phase_sli_parameters}. For performing these simulations, the prescribed gaseous inlet is chosen as boundary condition for the gas phase, and the Gorokhovski model with constants $K_1 = 0.05$, $K_2 = 1.0$ is applied, as justified by the analyses performed in the last sections.


\subsection{Level-set resolution and injection location}
\label{subsec:SLI_LGS_resolution_and_injection_location}


Firstly, the influence of the injection location and the level-set resolution are assessed. For the former one, the SLIs obtained at $x = 10$ mm shown in Figure \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx10_x10} are injected in the prescribed inlet which replicates the gaseous field for case UG100\_DX10. For the latter, the SLIs at $x = 5$ and 10 mm  from case UG100\_DX20 (respectively Figures \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx20_x05} and \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx20_x10}) are plugged into an aerodynamic field obtained by prescribing the gaseous phase statistics from this resolved case as detailed in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch6_jicf_lgs_gaseous_inlet_prescription}. Each case is named as its corresponding resolved atomization simulation plus its injection location: for instance, the baseline case is named UG100\_DX10\_x05 since it uses the SLI from resolved simulation UG100\_DX10 at the location $x = 5$ mm.

\caption{Integrated profiles of flux and SMD maps for numerical simulations comparing the effect of SLIs obtained with different resolutions and at several injection locations with the experimental results}
\label{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_resol_and_xInj}
\end{figure}

Profiles for the integrated SMD and flux are shown in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_resol_and_xInj}. The effect of the level-set resolution on the dispersed-phase spray is clearly remarkable: vertical flux profiles shows their maximum flux location in the coarse cases (UG100\_DX20) at a position closer to the wall, which does not agree with the experiments (the fine simulations UG100\_DX10 capture it accurately). This is a consequence of the lower vertical penetration of the resolved jets, as Figure \ref{fig:JICF_trajectories_validation} shows that coarser computations underestimate the experimental trajectory: most droplets are then injected at lower locations than those from the fine SLI. It is interesting to note that the vertical boundaries for the coarse SLIs simulations are similar to the fine ones, even higher for case UG100\_DX20\_x10. This is attributed to large particles being injected in these computations: droplets with the biggest diameters have a larger Stokes number and will travel along the vertical direction for longer than the smaller ones (such as the ones from the fine simulations) until they are atomized and relax towards the crossflow direction. Yet, such droplets are located in very low flux regions and do not represent a large portion of the spray. 

Particles are also generally larger for the coarse SLI simulations than for the fine one. The vertical SMD profiles show a more pronounced ballistic behaviour for case UG100\_DX20\_x05, which is caused by larger droplets sampled at the top part of the profile. These droplets, which can be seen in the snapshot of Figure \ref{fig:JICF_dx20_large_droplets}, are very large particles injected at $x = 5$ mm which are convected along the channel without undergoing any atomization. In particular, such droplets were found to be surrounded by a cluster of smaller droplets that might affect the gaseous phase in ensemble, preventing the large droplet from atomizating. These droplets are found at the top part of the spray, affecting the SMD vertical profiles as observed. Furthermore, since these particles are introduced from the beginning of the simulation (or a consequence of a first or second breakup event of a breakup cascade from a larger parent droplet), the SMD evolution along the channel will also be affected by these ones. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_LS_resol_and_xinj}: simulation UG100\_DX20\_x05 shows a decay with very different rates than the rest of the cases. Actually, the computation UG100\_DX20\_x10 does not show over-estimated ballistic profiles, and its the evolution of its SMD along the channel shows a profile such as the ones observed in the previous sections: a clearly exponential decay right after injection, which extends from $x = 10$ (injection point) to $x = 25$ mm, and then a liner decrease with a constant decay rate. This demonstrates that for the coarse case it is better to inject downstream, since the spray from the resolved simulation is better atomized. In terms of global size, the SMDs at $x = 80$ mm summarized in Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_turb_inj} show that the coarser simulations produce larger droplets, which approach the experimental results. Nevertheless, this is a consequence of larger droplets being injected, which atomize through a breakup cascade into smaller and smaller particles, and end up reaching equilibrium with the ambient gas at larger diameters than in the fine simulations. The results for the vertical flux profiles from Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_resol_and_xInj} shows that indeed the coarse simulations do not capture accurately the vertical location of maximum flux, and hence it is better to initiate lagrangian computations with the finer injectors.


%Larger droplets in the coarse simulations are consequence of the secondary atomization models, as it calculates the size of the children droplets in relation to the parent's diameter (Equation (\ref{eq:r_ch_goro})). These droplets are disintegrated into smaller ones through the cascade behaviour at the same time that they exchange momentum with the gaseous crossflow, reducing their relative velocity until they reach equilibrium with the gas. This equilibrium is reached then at larger diameters than in the fine SLI simulations, \hl{as shown by the spatial evolution of SMD at Figure XX}.

The SMD at $x = 5$ and $10$ mm for the resolved atomizations are also added for comparison}
\label{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_LS_resol_and_xinj}
\end{figure}

With respect to injection location, the differences for the SLIs for the coarse simulations have already been discussed, showing greated differences in profiles and SMD evolution along the channel. Regarding the SLIs from the fine simulations, the corresponding dispersed-phase computations do not show relevant dependencies on the injection location: all integrated profiles are similar in shape and in values, and the global SMDs obtained are practically identical. This might suppose that, even if the SLIs for UG100\_DX10 are spatially different in both locations as shown in Figure \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx10_x05}, and if the spray has already reached its resolution limit as indicated by the equal SMDs in Figure \ref{fig:ch5_spray_char_SMD_final}, injecting droplets through SLI obtained at different locations would make no difference in the lagrangian spray at $x = 80$ mm. In such case, a resolved simulation could provide a SLI with a cheaper computational cost than the one reported in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch5_JICF_computational_costs}, as the liquid removal sponge layer could be placed further upstream, for instance at $x = 6$ mm than at 11 mm, while retrieving an almost identical lagrangian spray in the dispersed-phase computation. This analysis reaffirms the idea that it is better to build a SLI with finer resolved atomization simulations: not only the particle's granulometry is better resolved than in an equivalent coarser simulation, but also a SLI can be built with a more reduced spatial domain due to a better atomization of the resolved droplets. It would be interesting to continue this study with even finer interface cell sizes in the resolved simulations, which has not been possible in this thesis due to the higher computational costs required.

\subsection{Spray velocities}
\label{subsec:SLI_LGS_velocity_effects}

Prescribed velocities through SLI are investigated here by using different combinations of the parameters in Eq. (\ref{eq:ch4_lagrangian_injection_velocity_with_mean_and_rms}). For the previous cases, the mean velocity was volume weighted ($\overline{u}_\mathrm{VW}$) and the $r$ law was Gaussian, injecting then into each SLI probe a stochastic component representing the normal dispersion of the droplet's velocities. Here, the effect of mean velocity is seen by injecting the arithmetic mean velocity ($\overline{u}$) while keeping constant the $r$ law to follow a Gaussian distribution. Then, the effect of RMS is assessed by changing the $r$ law to a uniform distribution and by removing the RMS component of the velocity (zero law), these two modifications performed with volume-weighted mean velocity being injected.

Results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_spray_velocities}, where the integrated SMD and flux profiles are plotted. The largest differences are observed for the treatment of the average velocities, since the vertical profiles change drastically when either arithmetic mean or VW averages are considered. By using the arithmetic mean ($\overline{u}$), droplets penetrate further away than with VW. The reason is the larger vertical velocities injected with arithmetic means: as shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_SLI_with_arithmetic_mean_and_VW}, droplets at the top of the spray are injected with faster vertical velocity, and since these droplets are larger, they travel further along the vertical direction. The imposition a different liquid velocity field might also affects secondary atomization, since as observed in the SMD vertical profile the droplets at the top part of the spray are smaller than at the bottom one, creating then a counter-ballistic behaviour which is not physical in such a JICF configuration. The fluw profile also shows a flatter shape in the center of the spray instead of a peaky one, indicating concentration of droplets in a wide region around the spray center. Therefore, a proper prescription of accurate mean velocities is crucial for dispersed-phase simulations when using SLI. 

Regarding the effect of the $r$ law governing the RMS component of the droplets, the results show that the imposition of one law or another affects the spray penetration: the minimum upper vertical in found for the uniform law, agreeing with the experimental bounds, while the maximum one is obtained for the gaussian one. All cases show a correct ballistic behaviour at the top of the spray, which indicates that the counter-ballistic shape observed for the blue curve is due to the average velocity imposed to the droplets. However, the droplets obtained with the uniform and zero laws are smaller than for the gaussian one. Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_spray_velocities}  alo shows that the final SMD obtained is effectively lower for these two cases. The vertical location of maximum flux is properly retrieved for the gaussian and uniform laws, while the zero one shows a flat shape extending from $z = 5$ to 10 mm. This behaviour is again due to a similar concentration of droplets in this area: the zero law removes the RMS component of the droplets, injecting only the mean, therefore limiting the spatial dispersion of droplets. It is therefore recommended to use the gaussian law as the way to prescribe RMS velocities, since in this case the sampled resolved droplets within the probles follow generally this shape as it was demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:injectors_extra_velocities_interesting}. Other configurations, however, might require other prescribing laws more representative of their actual sprays.

\subsection{Droplets diameters}

In general, the diameters injected within each SLI probe $f_0 \left( D \right)$ follow a lognormal law with a mean diameter given by the SMD and a standard deviation as given by $s_g$ from Eq. (\ref{{eq:ch5_f0_lognormal_distr_expression}}). This parameter can be studied by performing a simulation where the prescribed diameters are constant and equal to the SMD within each probe. The results for this simulation are given in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_f0}, and the global SMDs are reported in Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_f0}. Prescribing droplets with a constant SMD produce a lagrangian spray with lower vertical bounds and with slightly smaller droplets, although in the same order as with the lognormal distrubiton. Overall, no significant differences are found when injecting with one $f_0$ or another.

%\subsection{Turbulence injection}
%
%The effect of synthetic turbulence at the inlet is assessed by injecting droplets with the SLI obtained from simulation UG100\_DX20\_NT at $x = 10$ mm (Figure \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx20_x10_NT}) in a channel where data from the same simulation is extracted and prescribed at the inlet through Eq. (\ref{eq:prescribed_inlet_u_gas_injection_law}). Results from the dispersed-phase simulation are shown in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_turbulence_injection} and Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_turb_inj}. By substracting turbulence, the vertical bound of the spray is lower, which indicates that turbulence plays a role in the dispersion of droplets and convects them further away vertically.

%
%secondary atomization is less agressive and the size of the droplets is larger, resulting in SMD profiles closer to experimentas values in both lateral and vertical directions and in a larger global SMD as shown in Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_turb_inj}. This influence of turbulence in breakup is expected, since it is known that a larger turbulent content enhances atomization \citepColor[reitz_modeling_1987]. Regarding flux, the vertical profile from Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_turbulence_injection} shows larger liquid content in the bottom part of the spray and an underestimated vertical location of the maximum flux location.

\subsection{Convergence-driven discretization}

The use of convergence-driven discretization through quadtrees is assessed by performing a simulation with the SLI injectors shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_SLI_with_quadtrees}. Results for the spatially-integrated profiles of flux and SMD at $x = 80$ mm  are shown in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_quadtrees}. As observed, by using this discretization strategy, the vertical penetration of the spray is lower, matching the actual experimental limits. The vertical location of maximum fuel flux also agrees pretty well with experiments. The vertical SMD profile shows a correct ballistic behaviour, yet it shows underestimated values for most of the range. Lateral profiles of SMD and the global SMDs from Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_quadtrees} also show this tendency to diameter underestimation. This behaviour seems contradictory, since actually it is expected that a better spatial refinement yields better results. Such reduction in particles sizes with convergence-driven discretization might be be caused by the different velocities imposed, since by looking at Figure \ref{fig:maps_SLI_with_quadtrees} these seem to be the magnitude differing the most with respect to the ad-hoc SLIs (flux and SMD profiles are very alike). The reasons for this behaviour are not yet fully understood and are left for future work.

\subsection{Operating condition}
\label{subsec:JICF_LGS_params_OP}

Finally, the operating condition is tested by injecting the SLIs obtained from case UG75\_DX10 at $x = 5$ mm (Figure \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG75_dx10_x05}) into a reduced channel with the corresponding gaseous statistics as given by the prescribed gaseous inlet methodology. The spatially integrated profiles of SMD and flux are shown in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_OP}. Similar features than for the high Weber operating condition are retrieved: vertical bounds are slightly overestimated, and the SMD profile along axis $z$ follows a ballistir profile. The maximum location of vertical flux is slightly overestimated, even though a flat profile for this location is obtained as in the experiments. The SMD profiles seem to be closer to experiments than the previous simulations for the high Weber case: this is confirmed by checking the global SMD in Table \ref{tab:SMD_deviations_OP}, which shows that it is underestimated by 20.64 $\%$ in the simulation. This supposses an optimistic improvement with respect to the high Weber case, which in the best case yielded an error of -36.64 $\%$. There are two possible reasons why the SMD might be more accurately resolved in the dispersed-phase simulations: 1) the SLIs from the level-set computations of this operatind condition are better resolved, since as the gaseous dynamic pressure is lower the resulting droplets from atomization are larger, and hence can be better captured by the employed mesh, or 2) relative velocities are better approximated in the lagrangian computations for this case due to the a lower velocity gaseous field, hence secondary atomization breaks droplets more smoothly and particles in equilibrium are closer to the experimental values. Given any of these two hypothesis (or both) to be true, this would suppose that actually the SLI methodology could work accurately for operating conditions involving lower gaseous velocities in the flow.

\section{Artificial delay in secondary breakup}
\label{sec:LGS_delay_secon_atom}

The previous sections have shown that the resulting sprays can be controlled through the different input parameters. These ones have been tested in several simulations for finding the most optimal configuration for better matching the experimental results. It has been found that this case is given for the secondary atomization model Gorokhovski with a prescribed inlet for the gas phase, and for the injection of liquid droplets with volume-weighted averaged velocities and with a RMS component imposed based on a gaussian distribution. For the high Weber number case, a SMD ballistic profile and a coherent flux distribution were obtained, although the particles sizes produced underestimated the experimental SMD by 37 $\%$. This deviation got reduced to 20 $\%$ for the low Weber point. These underestimations are thought to be caused by the secondary atomization model, which breaks droplets shortly after they are injected into the domain as they are not in equilibrium. The gaseous velocity field has a great influence in the granulometry produced, as it directly affects the particles breakup through the relative liquid-gas velocity.

\end{figure}

Since the low sizes obtained are thought to be due to large relative velocities at injection that enhance brekaup, this deviation is going to be reduced by testing a delay in secondary atomization $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$. The effect of this new parameter in the flow field can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_LGS_dx_atom}: it consists of deactivating the secondary atomization model during an axial distance of length $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$ after injection. In this way, the liquid particles exchange momentum  with the gas along this spatial region but do not break, accomodating their velocity to the gaseous field. A total of ten extra simulations have been performed, for which $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$ has been varied from 2 to 20 mm in steps of 2 mm. Note that case $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom} = 0$ mm corresponds to the simulation previously reported as the baseline case in all parametric studies.

In first place, the evolution of global SMD along the channel is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_x_param_dx_atom}. The effect of the atomization delay is clearly seen by the fact that the SMD stays constant and equal to the injected one within the region in which the breakup model is not activated. Then, once the atomization model is triggered, droplets start to breakup again and the SMD decreases rapidly according to an exponential law as shown previously. Nevertheless, the largest difference is found in the final SMD at which the curves stabilize: this value is found in increase with increasing $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$.  The SMDs at the experimental validation location can be better compared in Figure \ref{fig:SMD_vs_dx_atom}, which shows the evolution of SMD at the experimental validation location as a function of $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$. This magnitude evolves linearly in the simulations for the range tested, and for $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom} > 12$ mm, the SMD enters within the range of experimental uncertainties at $x = 80$ mm. These graphs show then that leaving a relaxation time for the liquid phase to accommodate to the gas has a positive effect on the global sprays produced, as the relaxation of droplets results later in a less aggressive secondary atomization.

\end{figure}

At last, the integrated profiles of flux and SMD at $x = 80$ mm are shown in Figure \ref{fig:profiles_LGS_JICF_dx_aom}. Despite the improvements in the global spray, the inclusion of the secondary atomization delay is detrimental for the spatially distributed sprays. Increasing $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$ makes the spray penetrate further, increasing its vertical bound, and flattens the volume flux curve due to the increase in spatial extention. Furthermore, the SMD curves show that this value increases with $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$ in the bottom part of the spray (regions with high flux), but do not augment in the same rate for the upper part of the sprays, inverting actually the ballistic behaviour from $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom} = 12$ mm.

%\section{Computational costs}

\section{Conclusions}

This chapter has reported and discussed results dispersed-phase computations performed with the SLI models derived from the resolved atomization simulations in Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}.

 In first place, the computational setup is described: the geometry is a priori fixed to the same one as the baseline used in the resolved computations, the mesh is then refined at the center of the channel in order to better resolved the gaseous phase for droplet transport. Previous experimental data relevant for the cases simulated are then reported: from these available data, it is justified that the high Weber case was chosen as the main one for study since it has been more extensively reported than others. Uncertainty of droplets sizes reported is unclear, and hence a little analysis is done by comparing several experimental works using PDA to provide an order for the errors SMDs is done: a 10 $\%$ error in SMD is estimated. 

Prior to the dispersed-phase computations, gaseous boundary conditions for the flow field are computed. In first place, the ALM methodology is tested. The initial input parameters directly obtained from the resolved atomization simulations do not optimize the flow perturbations, hence these parameters are tuned by hand to find a better configuration. Despite improvements in the flow field, it is found that the best of the cases cannot accurately capture the perturbed field of the resolved computations: it is concluded that the ALM model proposed is not sufficient to produce a realistic flow field in dispersed-phase computations. Improvements in this model could go towards the obtention of the ALM parameters through a multivariable optimization procedure; the addition of other geometrical features, such as a combination of actuators; or the inclusion of spectral effects to account for the transient dynamics of the flow, which are not considered by the static ALM proposed. To overcome the limitations of ALM, another methodology which consists of prescribing gaseous statistics retrieved from the resolved atomization simulations into a reduced computational domain is approached. This one shows a better approximation of the gaseous perturbations than the ALM cases, moreover with reduced computational costs due to a lower number of cells in the mesh employed. 

The dispersed-phase computations have then been divided into three main blocks, to test the different parameters of the models according to the diagram from Figure \ref{fig:dispersed_phase_sli_parameters}. \\


\textbf{BORRAR A PARTIR DE AQUI}: Firstly, the computational setup is described, whose only difference with the baseline mesh of the resolved atomization simulations is the mesh size at the center. Then, the available data for experimental validation of the simulations are summarized in $\S$\ref{sec:ch6_experimental_results}. Possible sources and values for the uncertainties of these data are then discussed in $\S$\ref{sec:jicf_dlr_experimental_uncertainty}, and previous numerical works on injection in the same configuration are summarized in $\S$\ref{ch6:previous_numerical_studies}. Then, the boundary conditions the gaseous and liquid phases in dispersed-phase simulations are detailed in $\S$\ref{sec:ch6_BC_gaseous_phase} and $\S$\ref{sec:JICf_LGS_liquid_BCs} respectively. For the former, two possible options are analyzed: the ALM method, which was introduced in Chapter \ref{ch4:sli_development}, and another proposed methodology based on prescribing statistics of the gaseous phase learnt from resolved simulations in a simplified channel. It is shown that the prescribed gas phase can retrieve better the gaseous phase features from the resolved case than the ALM. Then, dispersed-phase simulations are performed by testing the different input parameters to find the best configuration to experimental data. It is found that secondary atomization acts very soon after droplets injection, reducing the particles sizes along the channel first with a fast, exponential decrease and then with a slow, linear reduction. The lagrangian computations are specially sensitive to the gaseous boundary conditions, secondary atomization model, SLI resolution and the mean velocities prescribed. Overall, the tests performed with the high Weber operating point show good spray features but underestimate the global SMD of the spray by a 37 $\%$ in the best of the cases. This deviation is reduced to 20 $\%$ when changing to the low Weber operating point, indicating that the SLI methodology could work better at low speed configurations where either atomization is better resolved by the resolved computations, or the secondary atomization model breaks droplets to a lesser extent. Finally, a delay in the secondary atomization is introduced by unplugging the secondary atomization model and let lagrangian particles convect without breaking, relaxing towards the gaseous field before breakup takes place. As a result, the deviations in droplets sizes are improved, confirming that it is the relative velocity what mostly affects breakup and creates the underestimation for the unaltered configuration.
