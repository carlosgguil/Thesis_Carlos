\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents results from lagrangian simulations performed with the SLI models described in Chapter \ref{ch4:sli_development}. The test case used is the academic JICF of \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002], for which resolved simulations of the atomization process were detailed in Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}. Data for these computations are used to build the injectors in order to run dispersed phase simulations in the same configuration, which are shown to be less computationally expensive than the resolved ones. \hl{...}


\section{Computational setup}

The geometry replicating the experimental test bench is the same than the one used for the resolved simulations, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:numerical_setup_maquette_JICF_DLR}. The operating points simulated are the ones from Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}. Regarding the mesh employed, it was shown in $\S$\ref{sec:ch5_initial_conditions} that an element size of $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm allows to transport the estimated turbulence in these cases. Nevertheless, the simulations from Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations} use a mesh with this cell size only inside the plenum upstream and around the injector, while downstream the injector the mesh size is enlarged as there is no liquid at this region. This mesh was shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh}. In the lagrangian simulations performed in this chapter, injection is performed at the sampling planes downstream the injector seen in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_IBs_sketch_discretization}, and the region of interest extends up to a location at $x = 80$ mm downstream the injector, which corresponds to the location where the experiments from \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] report results on fluxes and SMD. Therefore, lagrangian simulations use a baseline cell size of $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm in the plenum from the gaseous inlet up to $x = 85$ mm downstream the injector in order to allow for turbulent transport up to the experimental validation plane (located at $x = 80$ mm). The mesh used, shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh_LGS}, is composed of $74 \cdot 10^6$ elements, being therefore heavier than the baseline mesh employed for the resolved simulations but eventually lighter due to the lack of AMR (see the increase of element size in the resolved simulations at Figure \ref{fig:JICF_nelem_increase_t_0_to_2}, which shows that the smallest mesh obtained for a established jet contains $200 \cdot 10^6$ elements). Liquid particles are injected in this mesh as lagrangian point-particles whose dynamics follow the equations from  $\S$\ref{sec:ch3_EL_formalisms}. The energy equation is not considered since the test bench is at ambient temperature and evaporation does not take place.

Therefore, lagrangian simulations use a baseline cell size of $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm in the plenum from the gaseous inlet up to $x = 85$ mm downstream the injector. Furthermore, the mesh is refined \hl{in the region immediately downstream the injection nozzle to} $\Delta x = 0.3$ mm to allow for a better resolution of the gaseous field perturbed by the ALM, as the turbulent structures from the resolved simulations reported in $\S$\ref{ch5:subsec_turbulent_structures_in_gaseous_field} have smaller characteristic sizes than the turbulence further upstream. It is, however, worth to keep in mind that the gaseous field close to the interface was refined in the resolved simulations to the interface mesh size, allowing for a better resolution of turbulence. This refinement is not available in the dispersed phase simulations, therefore the refinement to $\Delta x = 0.3$ mm. The mesh used, shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh_LGS}, is composed of \textbf{XX} elements, being therefore larger than the baseline mesh employed for the resolved simulations but eventually cheaper due to the lack of AMR, as simulations. Liquid particles are injected in this mesh as lagrangian point-particles whose dynamics follow the equations from  $\S$\ref{sec:ch3_EL_formalisms}. The energy equation is not considered since the test bench is at ambient temperature and evaporation does not take place.

%\section{Evaporation phenomena}
%
%\textbf{Note: this analysis could perfectly be in the previous chapter}.
%
%As indicated in Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}, the temperatures of both liquid kerosene and gaseous air are low (290 and 288 K respectively) and there is not direct evaporation of fuel. Nevertheless, some evaporation can occur at ambient temperature if the vapour pressure of the liquid is lower than the ambient pressure. In the experiments, the ambient pressure is $p_g = 6$ bar, while the vapour pressure of kerosene at $288$ K is $p_{vap} = 0.003$ bar \citepColor[shepherd_flash_2000]. Therefore, evaporation might be possible.
%
%It is tested that ... Two characteristic times are used in the low We case (since the lowest velocity is found there, and the droplets take more time to reach the validation plane at 80 mm)/
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%	\item The time that a droplet takes to reach the plane x = 80 mm. From the SPS results in $\S$\textbf{??} (or Table \textbf{??}), the first droplets at x = 10 mm are obtained at $t_{resolv} = 0.3$ ms after injection. Then, the first droplets injected at this location in the lagrangian simulations reach the validation plane after $t_\mathrm{lagr} = $ ms. Hence, a characteristic time defined as the :
%	
%	\begin{equation}
%	\tau_{validation} = t_{resolv}  + t_\mathrm{lagr}
%	\end{equation}
%	
%	\item Evaporation time rate is used by means of the $d^2$ law. This law that the square of the droplet's diameter diminishes linearly with time:
%	
%	\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:d2_law}
%	d^2 \left( \right) = d_0^2 - K t
%	\end{equation}
%	
%	
%	where $K$ is the evaporation rate and $d_0$ the initial diameter of the droplet. The value K ... (see 2006 Ghassemi).

%	
%	\begin{equation}

\section{Experimental results from literature}
\label{sec:ch6_experimental_results}

The study from \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] reports results on the droplets average size SMD and the liquid volume fluxes in the plane $x = 80$  mm perpendicular to the crossflow. In the resolved simulations of Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations} the liquid spray could not reach this location: the increase in mesh size due to a continuous liquid injection and formation of droplets due to atomizatio yielded computations unfeasible if liquid was allowed to travel too far downstream, and hence the liquid domain was restricted up to $x = 10, 15$ mm for the fine and coarse resolutions respectively. This limitation does not apply in the dispersed phase simulations, which can be transported up to the outlet of the domain due to their lower cost compared to the resolved ones. Therefore, the dispersed phase simulations will be compared to the experimental results presented at 80 mm.

Experiments results from PDA measurements can be found in the articles \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] and \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002]. Among those, quantitative maps of SMD and volume flux are given, which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_Becker_expe_results}. For both operating points, the volume flux shows a circumferential pattern where the largest flux is located at the center and is reduced radially. Most of the fuel is then located at the center of the spray plume, which is a common feature in liquid jets in crossflow \citepColor[wu_spray_1998]. The maximum value of volume flux is lower for the low Weber case than in the high Weber one, which is expected since the injected liquid mass flow rate is lower for the former than for the later to keep the same momentum flux ratio $q$ in both cases, as Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions} shows. Regarding the $SMD$, both maps show a ballistic, layered profile where the largest droplets are located in the top part of the spray. This is due to the higher inertia of the biggest droplets produced, which penetrate further than the smallest ones \citepColor[wu_breakup_1997]. In general, $SMD$ values are larger in the low Weber case since the dynamic pressure (or equivalently, the gaseous velocity) is lower, and the size of the droplets produced were found to be highly dependent on this parameter \citepColor[becker_breakup_2002].

Complementary to the maps, qualitative results are also present in the literature which can also be used for validation. These ones are given as the integrated profiles of the liquid volume flux and flux-averaged $SMD$ over the $z$ and $y$ directions, which are then respectively dependent on $y$ and $z$. The equations to obtain such measures are given by Eqs. (\ref{eq:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}):


\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}
\begin{align}
\langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_y} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) dy    & ~~~~  ; & \langle SMD \left( z \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_y \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dy \\
\langle q_l \left( y \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_z} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) dz    & ~~~~  ; & \langle SMD \left( y \right) \rangle =  \frac{1}{L_z \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dz
\end{align}
\end{subequations}


%\begin{equation}
%\langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_y} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) dy ~~~~; ~~~~ \langle SMD \left( z \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_y \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_y} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dy
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\langle q_l \left( y \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_z} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) dz ~~~~; ~~~~ \langle SMD \left( y \right) \rangle = \frac{1}{L_z \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle} \int_0^{L_z} q_l \left( y, z \right) SMD \left( y, z \right) dz
%\end{equation}

The application of these equations to the experimental results yield the curves from Figure \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}. The integrated volume flux over $y$ (Figure \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results_over_y}) shows an increase of the volume flux from the bottom part of the spray (PDA measurements closer to wall, for $z < 2$ mm, could not be performed \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002]) until the spray center, where the maximum flux is reached. Then, the flux decreases with $z$ until there is no more liquid present. Flux values are generally larger for the high $We$ point than for the low $We$ one, and the quantity of liquid extends up to further upstream for the former than for the latter due to its larger liquid velocity at injection. Regarding the SMD profiles, both cases follow a ballistic behaviour. The spray of the high $We$ point contains droplets of larger mean size than the low $We$ one.

With respect to the profiles integrated over $z$ (Figure \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results_over_z}), both SMD and flux lines follow parabollic profiles with the largest values present at $y = 0$, i.e. the coordinate for which the largest fluxes are found. The behaviour of the profiles depending on the operating point follow the same tendencies than in Figure \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results_over_y}: lower fluxes and larger droplets for the low $We$ case.

%\section{Sources of uncertainty in PDA measurements}
\section{Uncertainty in experimental data}

The experimental results previously shown, obtained by \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002], were obtained through PDA measurements. PDA is one of the most popular experimental techniques to characterize sprays, since it is non-intrusive and provies information on droplets size and velocities which can then be used to also estimate fluxes. It is not, however, exempt of errors, since it is built on the assumption that droplets are spherical and it is well known that PDA measurements yield considerable erros on droplets sizes and fluxes \citepColor[tropea_optical_2011]. Several sources of error have been identified in the past. \citeColor[bachalo_method_1980] explained that optics play a paramount role: the optical setup can lead to detection errors produced by phenomena associated to the misalignment of dual-beam reflected and refracted rays (Gaussian beam Effect) or to the well-known slit effect, which is cause a truncation on the measurement volume through a slit placed so that the droplet volumes to measure can be defined \citepColor[doublet_effet_2019]. Not associated to the actual setup, modifications in the refractive indices of droplets could affect the scattering and yield important errors in particle sizes, specially relevant in multicomponent fuels such as kerosene. The role of the droplet non-sphericity was discussed, stating that PDA is prone to size overestimation when particles are deformed or oscillate in a preferential direction, as also discussed by \citeColor[damaschke_optical_1998]. \citeColor[dullenkopf_comparative_1998] performed PDA measurements on two injectors, a pressure-swirl and an airblast atomizer, and quantified the errors in mass flux by comparing with the results obtained from a patternator. They identified three main sources of error in the flux estimation: the size measurement (which is powered to 3 to calculate the flux, hence increasing exponentially the flux errors), the number count of droplets and the reference area used for measurements (the smaller the area the better, since it can also avoid counting droplets twice). They found that the flux errors on the pressure swirl fluxes were of the order of 10 $\%$, while in the airblast configurations these increased up to 30 $\%$, and also showed that the SMDs could vary up to 30 $\%$ depending on the PDA system used. \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1998] tested an airblast configuration and discussed several possible sources of error in sizes, highlighting the contribution of alignment uncertainties in the setup ($\sim 1~\%$) the change in refractive indices due to heating ($\sim 3.5~\%$) and to deformation of the sampled particles, since accelerated droplets at high velocity environments will be elliptical rather than spherical and the droplets sizes would be overestimated, propagating later the error to the fluxes calculations (this would explain the larger errors found by \citeColor[dullenkopf_comparative_1998] in their airblast atomizer with respect to the pressure-swirl one). In total, uncertainty on dropsizes was quantified to be of 7 $\%$ while the error on fluxes added up to 10 $\%$ if the particles concentration was not too high. It is worth to remark that the test bench of \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1998] is the same one that \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] used later at DLR to test the liquid kerosene JICF dealt in this theses (even though the atomizer and the operating conditions are different, the PDA systems and optical configurations are equivalent). The experiments from \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] do not actually provide data on the dropsize uncertainties, but do discuss the errors on mass fluxes and report mean deviations of 20 $\%$ and maximum of 37 $\%$. A posterior study on this configuration was done by \citeColor[becker_experimental_2004], who tested a swirled injector and reported errors on the SMD of $\sim 5 \%$ (no data on fluxes) attributed to optical misalignment and hardware setting. \citeColor[tropea_optical_2011] makes a review on experimental methods involving optical techniques to characterize disperse multiphase flows, and states that PDA measurements often show uncertainted in flux measurements from $20~\%$ up to several hundrers, while errors in particle size often range, in ideal conditions, from 10 to 30 $\%$. 

The objective here is to estimate possible errors in the experimental measurements of \ref{fig:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results} to obtain confidence intervals for validation of numerical results. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, this study gives a mean uncertainty of 20 $\%$ in the fluxes but does not provide data on the diameters. For the same test bench but with different atomizers and operating conditions, \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1998] reports 7 $\%$ and 14 $\%$ of errors for the droplets diameters and fluxes, respectively, while \citeColor[becker_experimental_2004] give SMD uncertainties of $\sim 5 \%$. Even though the PDA setup is identical in the three studies, the provided errors differ among each other, which might be due to the operating conditions, the atomizer or modifications in the optical setup (indeed, \citeColor[doublet_effet_2019] showed through a error propagation analysis that the uncertainties in the diameters were actually spetially sensitive to the elevation angle of the PDA detectors rather than to other parameters). Therefore, in order to estimate the uncertainty of the diameters in the the experimental setup of \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002], it will be assumed that the relation between the dropsizes and fluxes errors is similar as in the study performed in the same testbench (and in similar operating conditions) by \citeColor[brandt_experimental_1998]: errors between fluxes and diameters differ by a factor of 2, which in case of \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] yields diameter uncertainties of 10 $\%$ since their mean uncertainty for the fluxes is of 20 $\%$. It is important to keep in mind that this estimated error in droplets size is only approximative and could greatly vary in the actual experiments. \\ %Generally, as shown by the previous literature review,  errors in PDA measurements on droplets sizes are not often reported and characteristic 

Since \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002] give values on the flux uncertainties and their experimental data are available, it is possible to estimate the fluxes obtained from the experiments. The flux map ax $x = 80$ mm for the high Weber operating condition together with the grid composed of the probes through which the spray has been sampled is shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_previous_numerical_results}a. Square probes with 2 mm sides are placed as shown in the figure. Each probe contains a volume flux value $q_l$ which is stored at the center of the probe to plot the maps (as done in the SLI injectors of Figures 
\ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG75_dx10_x05} to \ref{fig:injectors_sli_uG100_dx20_x10_NT}). The grid is then composed of $N_y = 11$ probes in the lateral direction and $N_z = 9$ in the vertical one. Given an arbitrary probe located at a position $\left( j,k \right)$ (where $j$ is the probe index in the lateral direction $y$ and $k$ in the vertical one $z$) with surface $S_\mathrm{j,j}$, the absolute liquid flux through this probe can be calculated by applying Eq. (\ref{eq:ch4_volume_flux_definition}) to the probe volume flux $q_{l{j,k}}$:

\begin{equation}
Q_{l_{j,k}} = q_{l_{j,k}} S_{j,k}
\end{equation}

Then, the total liquid flow rate from the map can be calcuated by adding all the absolute fluxes from each probe:

\begin{equation}
Q_{l} = \sum_{j=1}^{N_y} \sum_{k=1}^{N_z} Q_{l_{j,k}} = \sum_{j=1}^{N_y} \sum_{k=1}^{N_z} q_{l_{j,k}} S_{j,k} = 4062 ~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}
\end{equation}

which, as shown, gives a value of $4062 ~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The injected flow rate for this case is $Q_{l,\mathrm{inj}} = 3710~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as given in Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}. Therefore, the PDA measurements report a flux excess with respect to the injected flow rate of $9.5~\%$. This deviation is comprised within the mean uncertainty of $20~\%$ provided by the authors of the experiments. Nevertheless, it is paramount to consider this flux overestimation when comparing with the dispersed-phase simulations performed with SLI, since the liquid rates injected in these ones do not correspond to the experimental flux of $4062 ~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ but to the injected one of $Q_{l,\mathrm{inj}} = 3710~ \mathrm{mm}^3~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In reality, if the PDA was exempt of errors (which, as explained previously, is never the case), the retrieved experimental flux could not be larger than the injected one as mass is not created in the simulation: and actually, it should be lower since there is filming in the experiments, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_snapshot_expe_filming}, that reduces the liquid flux perpendicular to the crossflow. The resolved simulations could capture this filming phenomenon in the jet, and the filming flux was quantified in $\S$\ref{sec:ch5_direct_measurement_fluxes_IB}.

\section{Previous numerical studies}
\label{ch6:previous_numerical_studies}

Prior to this work, several authors have performed dispersed-phase simulations on the experimental configuration of \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002]. All cases simulated the high Weber operating point from Table \ref{tab:jicf_operating_conditions}. \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] simulated the jet in steady crossflow by considering the early liquid as a cylinder deflected by the airflow, which exchanges momentum with a modified drag coefficient, sheds mass and produces droplets whose properties are given from experimental correlations. Later on, \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] extended this model to account for shear breakup of ellipsoids and flattened liquid jets (to account for more realistic JICF dense core effects) in both steady and unsteady crossflows, by using semi-empirical correlations. Independently of these studies, \citeColor[jaegle_large_2009] and \citeColor[senoner_simulation_2010] also developed models with this configuration: the former injected a developed spray at the liquid nozzle while accounting for a modified drag law in the near-nozzle region to mimic the liquid column momentum exchange, and the later injected big blobs at the nozzle but accounting for secondary atomization. All these models (except for
\citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] since it was more recently improved by \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016]) are summarized in the diagram of Figure \ref{ch3:subsec_lagrangian_liquid_JICF} and detailed in $\S$\ref{fig:state_art_injection}.

In order to position the current work into the state of the art, it is worth to compare it to the previous studies performed. All the works aforementioned use data shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_Becker_expe_results} to validate the computations. Nevertheless, not all the numerical studies previously mentioned use all these data for validation, but only display a few of them. Table \ref{tab:previous_numerical_studies_on_jicf_dlr_recap} shows a summary of the validation data directly available in the previous works. None of the papers referred present data on the SMD map, while only \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] give data on the global SMD obtained. Most of the works give data on the flux and SMD profiles integrated over $y$, while only \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] provides profiles integrated over $y$. %The only work which does not provide data on SMD distributions is \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016]. 

In first place, the flux maps from all the previous works that provide these information are shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps_previous_numerical_results}. The experimental map is also show for visual comparison. In general, all maps show a circular flux shape and an overestimation of the maximum flux location in the vertical direction (the integrated maps discussed in the following lines confirm this observation). Since the data belonging to the the maps of the numerical studies were unfortunately not directly available, it was obtained by digitalizing the 2D maps depicted in the papers. The grid used for digitalizion is not shown since it was finer than the experimental grid in order to properly capture all the features of the maps, and showing it together with the maps hinders their visualization. From the digitalized maps, the total flux in the plane can be calculated as done previously for the experimental data applying Eq. (\ref{eq:ch6_Ql_total_estimation_from_flux_profiles}). The results are shown in Table \ref{tab:previous_numerical_studies_on_jicf_dlr_values}: even though the fluxes are not exactly equal to the injected flux (the digitalization methodology is not robust enough to retrieve accurately the actual fluxes plotted by the authors, which should be equal to the injected flux and therefore differ from the values obtained), all values are lower than the flux integrated from the experimental map. The only exception is \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002]: in fact, this work does not display neither maps nor absolute rates, but normalized integrated profiles which in this case have been de-normalized with the injected flux (it has been assumed that the flux retrieved at 80 mm is equal to the injected one). The integrated profiles of the fluxes shown in Figure \ref{fig:previous_works_profiles_comparison_with_expe} confirm these lower flow rates obtained in all simulations performed by each author. These integrated profiles have been obtained through either direct digitalization of the curves when available (Table \ref{tab:previous_numerical_studies_on_jicf_dlr_recap}) or by applying Eq. (\ref{eq:integrated_results_Becker_expe_results}) to the maps when not available. The error bars in the experimental flux profiles of Figure \ref{fig:previous_works_profiles_comparison_with_expe} correspond to a deviation of 20 $\%$ in each point.

As previously mentioned, none of the previous works display SMD maps. Most of the works report, on the other hand, $SMD$ integrated profiles over $y$: these have been digitalized and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:previous_works_profiles_comparison_with_expe}.   The error bars in the experimental SMD profiles at this Figure correspond to a deviation of 10 $\%$ in each point. All cases show a ballistic behaviour in which the SMD increases with vertical distance $z$. The SMD profiles integrate over $z$ are only present in \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002], who obtained accurate results at the center of the spray (region of maximum flux location) and showed a SMD overestimation when moving away towards the edges.

From the SMD integrated profiles over $y$, a global SMD can be estimated by performing a further integration along the $z$ direction:

\begin{equation}
 SMD =  \frac{1}{ \int_0^{L_z} \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle dz} \int_0^{L_z} \langle q_l \left( z \right) \rangle \langle SMD \left( z \right) \rangle dz
\end{equation}


Results are shown in Table \ref{tab:previous_numerical_studies_on_jicf_dlr_values}.  \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] do not provide the integrated SMD profile, yet they give directly the global SMD. Generally, all SMDs show a good agreement with respect to the experimental value of \citeColor[becker_breakup_2002]. The works of \citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002] and \citeColor[eckel_semi-empirical_2016] perform a calibration of their model to match the experimental size distribution, hence such a good agreement is expected. Similar is the case of \citeColor[jaegle_large_2009], who already injected the experimental size distribution at the injector without including any secondary atomization model: then, the flux-weighted SMD is expected to be close to the SMD of this distribution. \citeColor[senoner_simulation_2010] does not inject any distribution but injects droplets at the liquid nozzle with size equal to the nozzle's diameter, drags them with a modified momentum transfer law at the column liquid region and then applies the stochastic secondary breakup model of \citeColor[gorokhovski_stochastic_2001], used in this thesis and explained in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch4_goro_model}, to account for further breakup of droplets. The good results in terms of global SMD and integrated profiles obtained in his work denote the suitabitliy of the stochastic breakup model to simulate such configurations.




%\citeColor[rachner_modelling_2002], who performed the first computations on this experimental bench, stated that the injected fuel flow rate is not conserved in the measurements at $x = 80$ mm since "\textsl{PDA measurements are less accurate at high local liquid fluxes because of dense spray effects} (sic)". \hl{...} The experimental volume flux map at $x = 80$ together with the grid in whose center the measurement probes have been located is shown in Figure \hl{\textbf{XX}} left. For each discrete probe ($j,k$), the absolute flux $Q_{l_{j,k}}$ can be calculated as:

\section{Obtention of boundary conditions for gaseous phase}
\label{sec:ch6_BC_gaseous_phase}

Prior to liquid injection, it is necessary to establish an initial solution for the gaseous phase as done for the resolved simulations. The difference with respect to the resolved simulations is that in this case, the initial solutions needs to consider the ALM since the dense core blockage effect needs to be modelled in the dispersed phase simulations. All the details of the model were addressed in $\S$\ref{sec:ch4_dense_core_modelling}. In this section, results from the resolved simulations are employed as input parameters to feed the ALM model. It is shown that the initial parameters do not capture correctly the gaseous turbulent structures, and are tuned in order to find an optimal configuration that better retrieves them. This optimal configuration is nevertheless not able to capture all the gaseous features, and another methodology to prescribe inlet boundary conditions obtained from the resolved atomization simulations in a reduced computational domain.


\subsection{Actuator Line Model}

%\subsection{Setup of actuator model}

An actuator representing the dense core can be defined for performing the dispersed-phase simulations by using results from the resolved atomization simulations as input parameters to ALM, whose control variables were summarized in Table \ref{tab:alm_parameters}. An example of an actuator representing the dense core in gaseous simulations can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:u_inst_SPS_and_ALM}. As observed, it is graphically represented as a cylinder with the initial point located in the injection nozzle exit and final point in the breakup location of the resolved dense core estimated from the resolved simulations. The actuator points (not shown in the figure) are located uniformly along the central line of the cylinder. The discrete forces applied to each point are then mollified in the neighbouring cells in order to avoid flow singularities.


\begin{figure}[h!]

The snapshots correspond to the resolved simulation UG100\_DX10 (\textsl{left}) and to a gaseous simulation with the optimal actuator (\textsl{right})}	
	\label{fig:u_inst_SPS_and_ALM}
\end{figure}


In order to assess the ALM, the results from the high Weber operating point for the fine case (UG100\_DX10) are used: the actuator point coordinates $x_b$, $z_b$ are obtained from the mean values of Figure \ref{fig:dense_core_mean_parameters_scatterplots}, while the force $\textbf{F}_\mathrm{DC}$ is taken from Table \ref{tab:dense_core_pressures_and_force_parameters}. These values, summarized in Table \ref{tab:jicf_lgs_ALM_parameters}, represent an \textbf{Initial} actuator. As it will be shown, it is found that the disturbance effect created by this actuator was not optimal to represent the disturbance effect of the dense core. Thus, the ALM control variables were tuned until finding an actuator which was found to better match the perturbed gaseous field: this one is summarized as the \textbf{optimal} actuator from Table \ref{tab:jicf_lgs_ALM_parameters}. Furthermore, a third actuator was tested to illustrate the effect of further increasing the imposed net dense core force: this one is defined as the \textbf{modified} actuator in the corresponding table. In this section, only the gaseous fields disturbed by the defined actuators are analyzed. The effect of such influences in the lagrangian liquid field is reported later in $\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_gaseous_phase_effect}.

In first place, the mean axial velocity fields in the symmetry plane $y = 0$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_Y}. The resolved case UG100\_DX10 is also displayed for comparison.  As observed, the initial actuator obtained by using the input values from the resolved atomization simulations creates only a slight perturbation downstream the cylinder location, but cannot properly retrieve the recirculation and deceleration regions which were captured by the resolved simulation. Changing the input parameters helps to better capture the perturbation effect: the optimal parameter enhances flow deceleration as visualized by the darker blue region, while the modified actuator creates a more intense perturbance which can also capture a recirculation bubble behind the cylinder as in the resolved atomization simulation. At a first glance, it might seem that the augmented actuator represents better the resolved perturbed field since it recovers the recirculation bubble; nevertheless, the optimal actuator can better retrieve the gaseous flow field further downstream as it is later demonstrated. In general, the optimization of the actuator is based on better matching the flow field in the region where droplets are injected, i.e. for $x > 5$ or 10 mm, as the gaseous field will affect the momentum exchange between phases and the secondary atomization of droplets.

	\label{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_Y}

A qualitative analysis of the ALM effect in the $y = 0$ plane can be done by looking at the velocity along the lines represented in Figure \ref{fig:ALM_gas_fields_plane_Y}. The velocity along the lines perpendicular to the $z$ axis is shown in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_ICS_ALM_lines_y0_along_x_ux_mean},while the lines perpendicular to the $x$ axis are shown in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_ALM_lines_iso-x_along_y_ux_mean}. The velocity profile for the unperturbed case is also plotted for comparison.

\subsection{Prescription of gaseous inlet from resolved simulations }
\label{subsec:ch6_jicf_lgs_gaseous_inlet_prescription}


\subsubsection{Methodology}

As previously shown, the ALM model has been proved to be able to perturb the gaseous field. \hl{From an initial actuator obtained from the parameters of the resolved atomization simulation, the forces have been tuned to seek for a better match of the mean velocity profiles in the dispersed-phase simulations}. The match, however, is not completely accurate and the perturbation effect from the resolved simulations cannot be fully captured by ALM, since the dynamics and topology of the liquid dense core hinder their modelling with the relatively simple ALM model developed. 

With the objective of trying to improve the matching of the resolvded gaseous fields, a different strategy has been approached. This one is based on obtaining the gaseous field in a plane perpendicular to the crossflow from the resolved simulations. The field is characterized by the mean and RMS values of the velocities in the three directions. Such profiles are then imposed in a reduced domain consisting of a box with length $150$ mm and cross-section 25x40 mm$^2$ representing the downstream part of the plenum from the JICF configuration of Figure \ref{fig:numerical_setup_maquette_JICF_DLR}. A schematic of the methodology is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:custom_inlet_methodology}. The velocity profiles are imposed at the inlet of the prescribed domain according to the following law:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{u} \left( \textbf{x}, t \right) = \overline{\textbf{u}} \left( \textbf{x} \right)  + r \left( t \right)  \textbf{u}_\mathrm{RMS} \left( \textbf{x} \right) 
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\textbf{u}} \left( \textbf{x} \right)$ and $\textbf{u}_\mathrm{RMS} \left( \textbf{x} \right)$ are the mean and RMS velocity distributions in the crossflow plane extracted from the resolved atomization simulations. $r \left( t \right)$ is a time-varying scalar sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1: $r \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1 \right)$. This velocity prescription law, which is based on the weak recycling method of synthetic turbulence injection by \citeColor[wu_large_1995], ensures that the injected $TKE$ in the dispersed phase simulations is the same as the one retrieved from the resolved atomization ones. \hl{Nevertheless, due to the coarser mesh employed in the reduced domain with respect to the }

\begin{figure}[h!]	
	\centering	\includeinkscape[inkscapelatex=false,scale=0.25]{./part2_developments/figures_ch6_lagrangian_JICF/gas_field_initial_conditions/custom_inlet_methodology}
	\caption{Methodology to prescribe mean and RMS velocity fields from resolved simulations in reduced domain for dispersed-phase computation.}
	\label{fig:custom_inlet_methodology}
\end{figure}

The mesh employed for performing simulations with the prescribed inlet is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_reduced_inlet}. The mesh, which contains $12 \cdot 10^6$ elements, has been refined up to a location $x = 40$ mm downstream the inlet to a mesh size $\Delta x = 0.3$ mm, while from $x = 40$ mm up to $x = 100$ mm, the mesh size has been set to $\Delta x = 0.5$ mm as in the mesh of Figure \ref{fig:jicf_dlr_mesh_LGS}. The finer cell size of $\Delta x = 0.3$ mm has been selected  with the objective of better capturing the turbulent structures created by the inhomogeneous gaseous velocity profile injected. Nevertheless, \hl{as it will be shown later}, this cell size is not resolved enough to capture those: in the resolved simulations of Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}, the cell size in the gaseous field around the liquid regions was of the order of the interface cell sizes ($20, 10~\mu$m) created by the ALM method, while such resolutions cannot be imposed into this reduced domain as the mesh size greatly increases and yields computations considerably expensive. Furthermore, a too fine mesh would create large volume fractions which are not in accordance with the application of lagrangian methods to simulate dispersed multiphase flows, which are applicable to small volume fractions \citepColor[murrone_numerical_2011].

\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Setup and results}

The injected profiles, shown in the maps of Figure \ref{fig:custom_inlet_methodology}, have been obtained from the location $x = 3$ mm downstream the liquid injector in the resolved atomization simulations. Other plane locations have been tested without observing significant differences in the velocity profiles in the dispersed-phase simulations. In fact, the range of the possible planes to retrieve gaseous data for prescribing inlet BCs is narrow: upstream $x = 3$ mm the jet dense core is present and mean gaseous profiles would contain velocities corresponding to the liquid phase, while further downstream the lagrangian spray is injected in the dispersed-phase simulations (the earliest injection location is $x = 5$ mm). Hence, the only reported case here corresponds to the location $x = 3$ mm. Since the computational domain is reduced with respect to the full computational configuration used for the ALM, the axial coordinates are shifted 3 mm and the experimental validation plane, located at 80 mm downstream the liquid injection nozzle in the test bench, corresponds to the location $x = 77$ mm as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_reduced_inlet}. Hereafter, however, all axial coordinates reported will be expressed in the absolute reference frame of the experimental test bench for easening comparison with the ALM dispersed-phase simulations.

\section{Procedure for setting dispersed-phase simulations}

In Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}, the five resolved atomization simulations from Table \ref{fig:location_JICF_ops_in_breakup_map} were performed and analyzed. These ones tested two mesh interface mesh resolutions ($\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 20, 10~\mu$m), two operating points ($We_g = 830, 1470$) and the influence of turbulence injection in one simulation for the coarse resolution, high $We_g$ case. Results shown a high dependency of the trajectories ($\S$\ref{subsec:ch5_jet_trajectories_results}) and jet topologies ($\S$\ref{sec:ch5_jet_evolution}) on the resolution, which led later to different spray characteristics ($\S$\ref{sec:ch5_sec_spray_characterization}) and resulting injectors ($\S$\ref{sec:ch5_learning_SLI}). Therefore, it is of interest to test such effects in the disperse-phase simulations by initializing these computations with the different injectors obtained.

Figure \ref{fig:dispersed_phase_sli_parameters} shows the different models involved in the dispersed phase simulations with their control parameters: they are split into the possible influences on the gas and liquid phases, as well as the secondary breakup which is considered as an interaction between both (even though it acts on the liquid phase, it needs the gas velocity for calculating the relative velocity in order to estimate liquid breakup). In this section, all the parameters from the SLI model in the JICF case are analyzed: a baseline configuration is chosen, which was found to be the most optimal one yielding the best match to the experimental results, and then each SLI parameter is modified individually. The baseline configuration consists of the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}

	\item The \textbf{gaseous phase} is provided by the \textbf{custom inlet} methodology. This one was found to better match the aerodynamic field from the resolved computation and produces a lagrangian spray closer to the experimental results, as demonstrated in $\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_gaseous_phase_effect}.
	
	\item \textbf{Secondary atomization model} is taken to be the Gorokhovski model with calibrated constants $K_1 = 0.05$, $K_2$ = 1. Calibration of the secondary model is reported in $\S$\ref{{subsec:second_atom_goro_calibration}}.
	
	\item \textbf{SLI} corresponds to the discretized spray obtained from the high Weber case at the finest resolution, UG100\_DX10, at location $x = 5$ mm. This case is chosen as the baseline one since 1) the operating point been previously studied by other authors and hence the results reported here can be easily compared ($\S$\ref{ch6:previous_numerical_studies}), 2) the finer interface cell size in the resolved simulation provides a better resolution of the sprays, and 3) the location closer to the injection point deviates less with respect to the experimental trajectory than the sampled spray further downstream (see Figure \ref{fig:JICF_trajectories_validation}). The effect of other operating conditions, resolved interface resolutions and injection locations is studied in $\S$\ref{subsec:SLI_LGS_resolution_and_injection_location},.
	
	\item \textbf{Spray velocities}: mean injection velocities are fixed to volume-weighted ones, while the $r$ law for RMS components is set to gaussian. Such parameters are analyzed in $\S$\ref{subsec:SLI_LGS_velocity_effects}.
	
	\item \textbf{Droplets sizes} prescribed are randomly sampled from a lognormal distribution fitting the histogram in each individual probe. 
	
	\item The \textbf{operating condition} is also change by performing a dispersed-phase simulation for the low Weber case with the corresponding SLI obtained. These results are reported in $\S$\hl{XX}.

\end{itemize}

	\caption{Schematic of parameters involved in SLI simulations and their interactions}	\label{fig:dispersed_phase_sli_parameters}
\end{figure}

With the objective of testing all the parameters involved in the lagrangian computations, a design of experiments process is followed in which each variable is changed in a one-at-a-time basis. The study of dispersed-phase simulations in then divided into three parts, which are enclosed by the dashed-colored lines in Figure  \ref{fig:dispersed_phase_sli_parameters}:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item The \textbf{gas phase} effect is analyzed by injecting lagrangian droplets with the baseline injectors in the gaseous fields previously analyzed in $\S$\ref{sec:ch6_BC_gaseous_phase}. The results are discussed in $\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_gaseous_phase_effect}. In this section, the establishment of the liquid phase and time needed to convergence of mean parameters are also  included.
	
	\item The \textbf{secondary atomization models} are analyzed in $\S$\ref{sec:SLI_LGS_secondary_breakup_models}. This section is divided into two parts: a first one in which the free constants of the Gorokhovski model are tuned, and a second one in which the three available. models are compared.
	
	\item Finally, the effects of the \textbf{liquid phase} parameters from SLI and operating conditions are reported in $\S$\ref{sec:effect_of_SLI_variables}. Besides the already introduced parameters, a last variable which consists of a spatial delay in which secondary atomization is not activated $\Delta x_\mathrm{atom}$ is also discussed.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Influence of secondary atomization model}
\label{sec:SLI_LGS_secondary_breakup_models}

To consider the secondary breakup of lagrangian droplets in dispersed-phase simulations, three atomization models are available ($\S$\ref{sec:ch4_secondary_atomization_modeling}): TAB, ETAB and Gorokhovski. All these models estimate breakup according to the Weber based on the relative velocity, which is the known parameter to control secondary atomization. Then, the exact instant of breakup and the size and number of children droplets are calculated differently by each model. The TAB and ETAB models belong to the same family and provide fixed values for the parameters controlling the model, while the Gorokhovski's stochastic model presents two constants ($K_1, K_2$) that are to be calibrated by the user. Therefore, first in this section firstly the Gorokhovski's stochastic model is calibrated in order to better match the experimental results, as it has been previously done in other works using the same model \citemColor[apte_les_2003,senoner_simulation_2010].  Then, the best configuration obtained is compared to the results from the TAB and ETAB models. It is found that these models provide good results in terms of flux distribution but that greatly underestimate the droplets sizes after atomization, while in the Gorokhovski model the two control variables can be tuner in order to get a better tradeoff between the droplets sizes and fluxes distribution.

\subsection{Calibration of Gorokhovski model}
\label{subsec:second_atom_goro_calibration}

The Gorokhovski stochatic model, described in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch4_goro_model}, presents two free constants $K_1$ and $K_2$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:gorokhovski_epsilon_parameters_definition}) which can be tuned for each particular case and which affect the size of the children droplets produced.  The constant $K_1$ affects the mean value of the generated children particles a breakup event, while $K_2$ controls the deviation from this mean \citepColor[senoner_simulation_2010]. The tested values for these constants are summarized in Table \ref{tab:lgs_DoE_goro_constants}. Three values for $K_1$ and three for $K_2$ have been tested, making a total of 9 simulations performed.

In first place, the effect of the constant $K_1$ is assessed by varying it with a fixed valued $K_2 = 1.0$. 


In first place, the value of the constant $K_2$ is assessed by fixing the  value of the other constant to $K_1 = 0.1$.
