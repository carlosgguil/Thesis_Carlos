\chapter{Convergence of SLI global parameters in BIMER}
\label{app:BIMER_SLI_convergence}

Spray characterization from the BIMER simulations of Chapter has been presented in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch8_BIMER_spray_char}: the total accumulation times of the simulations are summarized in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_SLI_t_prime_accumulation} and the amount of accumulated droplets in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_SLI_Ndr_accumulated}. The establishment of the sprays was shown through the convergence of the global SMD and liquid flux $Q_l$ in Figure \ref{tab:BIMER_SLI_t_prime_accumulation}. In this section, the convergence on the remaining parameters not previously shown are displayed: velocities in three directions are shown in Figures \ref{fig:app_BIMER_spray_velocities_establishment_mean} and \ref{fig:app_BIMER_spray_velocities_establishment_rms}, and deformation parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are seen in Figures \ref{fig:app_BIMER_spray_deformation_establishment_mean} and \ref{fig:app_BIMER_spray_deformation_establishment_rms}.
