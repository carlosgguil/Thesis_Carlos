\chapter{Resolved atomization simulations of BIMER}
\label{ch8:bimer_resolved_atomization}


\section{Introduction}

The multipoint burner BIMER was introduced in Chapter \ref{ch7:bimer_test_bench_and_aero}, where a study of the aerodynamic flow field for the operating conditions of interest was performed. Two operating points were simulated: the one tested by \citeColor[providakis_etude_2013] for which experimental data on the aerodynamic field was available, which was used for validating the simulations performed with YALES2; and the one tested by \citeColor[renaud_high-speed_2015] which provides experimental data on the non-reactive spray state. 

In this chapter, resolved simulations of the atomization process through one injector of the BIMER take-off stage, as done in Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations} for the academic JICF test case, are performed. The numerical setup and liquid injection operating point are described in $\S$\ref{sec:ch8_BIMER_computational_setup} and $\S$\ref{sec:ch8_BIMER_operating_condition} respectively. Then, the inlet velocity profiles from the aerodynamic computations which are relevant for jet breakup and droplet transport are shown in $\S$\ref{sec:ch8_BIMER_initial_conditions}. Results from resolved atomization simulations performed for \textbf{XX} interface mesh resolutions are shown in $\S$\textbf{XX}. Finally, injectors learnt and built from such simulations are discussed in $\S$\ref{sec:ch8_learning_SLI_in_BIMER}. These injectors are later used to initialise spray simulations at BIMER in Chapter \ref{ch9:BIMER_lagrangian}.



\section{Computational setup}
\label{sec:ch8_BIMER_computational_setup}

The computational geometry for performing the resolved atomization simulations is the same one as the one used for the aerodynamic ones, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_geometry_full_domain}. The fine mesh from Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_mesh_fine} is used, its details provided in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_meshes_gaseous}. The aerodynamic field described in $\S$\ref{ch7:BIMER_application_point} is used as initial condition for the resolved atomization simulations. The boundary conditions are also the same ones in all the boundary except for the liquid injection point, which for the aerodynamic simulations it was specified as solid wall and for the resolved ones is changed to inlet. 

The location of the liquid injection point in the take-off stage is shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_geometry_flower_details}. The injector consists of a nozzle with 8 mm length and a circular cross-section of diameter 0.3 mm. The injection nozzle can be appreciated in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_liquid_injector_views}, where zoomed-in views of the liquid injection point rear and front sides are shown. The direction of the incoming air $u_g$ and the liquid injection $u_l$ are detailed, as well as the crossflow direction $x_c$ obtained from the resolved atomization simulations (see $\S$\ref{sec:ch8_BIMER_initial_conditions}). A cut of the mesh in the injector is appreciated in the left figure: the cell size within the injector has been set to $35 \sim \mu$m, and the walls are refined to $15 \sim \mu$m. The right figure shows the dimensions of the gaseous inlet channel, which yield a hydraulic diameter of $D_h = 7.5$ mm.

\subsubsection*{Sampling planes in BIMER}

The purpose of the BIMER resolved simulations is to characterize the produced spray in order to create lagrangian injectors with the SLI methodology to initialize dispersed phase computations. Therefore, the spray must be sampled in the fashion as it was done for the DLR JICF, whose sampling planes were shown in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_interior_boundaries_surface_measurements}. In that test case, the defined sampling planes were perpendicular to the crossflow axis $x$, since the jet deviates and atomizes producing a spray that moves in this direction. BIMER presents a more complex geometry representative of real injection systems where the absolute reference system is not aligned with the liquid fuel injection point chosen. Therefore, it is convenient to change the reference system to a local one which is aligned with the jet deviation direction (i.e. the local crossflow direction). This direction is denoted as $x_c$ and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_liquid_injector_views} right. It has been obtained by performing resolved simulations and checking visually the JICF direction. The local reference system is defined by the orthogonal coordinates $\textbf{x}_c^T =\left\lbrace x_c, y_c, z_c \right\rbrace$ obtained through a transformation from the global coordinate system. This local system, shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_local_FoR_and_sampling_planes}, is centered at the liquid injection point. The figure also shows the location of the sampling planes, which are perpendicular to the $x_c$ axis and are expressed in relation to the injection diameter $d_\mathrm{inj}$. In all simulations performed, a sponge layer where liquid is artificially suppressed has been located at $x_c/d_\mathrm{inj} = 12$ to reduce the cost of the computations.

\section{Operating condition}
\label{sec:ch8_BIMER_operating_condition}

The ambient conditions and inlet gaseous flow rate for the operating point to study are shown in Table \ref{tab:gaseous_operating_points_BIMER}. These ones characterize the aerodynamic field of the overall burner. To determine now the operating point and classify it into the JICF breakup map, the liquid and gaseous parameters relevant to the single multipoint injector need to be stated.

%\begin{equation}
%x/d_\mathrm{inj} ~~ ; ~~ \textcolor{blue}{z/d_\mathrm{inj} }
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Gaseous phase}

%According to \citeColor[barbosa_etude_2008], $80 \%$ of the air flow rate goes through the take-off stage and $20 \%$ goes through the take-off one. The study of \citeColor[renaud_high-speed_2015] shows that the percentage through the pilot is actually $13.5 \%$, hence $86.5 \%$ goes through the take-off. Considering the application point in Table \ref{tab:gaseous_operating_points_BIMER}, this makes a total of $\dot{m}_{g,\mathrm{takeoff}} = 37.2815 ~ $ g s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a flow rate $Q = 0.04567 $ m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$. Since that this flow rate is split through 20 vanes, the flow rate per canal is $Q_g = 2.2833 \cdot 10^{-3}$ m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$. With an area of 6x10 mm$^2$ (see Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_liquid_injector_views}), the estimated gas bulk velocity is:

%\begin{equation}
%u_g = Q_g/A = 38 ~ \mathrm{m} ~ \mathrm{s}^{-1}
%\end{equation}

The aerodynamic field inside BIMER for the operating points of interest was discussed in Chapter \ref{ch7:bimer_test_bench_and_aero}. From this study, a fine mesh consisting of 38 million elements was chosen (see Table \ref{tab:BIMER_meshes_gaseous}). The gaseous field for the application point, which is the chosen one to perform spray simulations, was studied in $\S$\ref{ch7:BIMER_application_point}. This solution is taken as the initial condition from the resolved atomization simulations.

For the resolved atomization simulations, the relevant gas conditions are those found close to the liquid injection point. In the case of a simple JICF geometry like the one studied in Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}, the gas and liquid flows directions are known, and the gaseous conditions impinging the jet and relevant for liquid breakup are easily determined. For a complex geometry, swirled injector such as BIMER, the crossflow direction is not known a prior and needs to be determined. For such purpose, resolved simulations are a useful tool since they provide all the information regarding the jet. For determining the crossflow reference system $\textbf{x}_c$, displayed in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_local_FoR_and_sampling_planes},  a first simulation was run and the direction in which droplets were convected was taken as the crossflow direction $x_c$. 

Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_Umean_profile_with_jet} left shows the gas mean streamlines through the inlet vane of the multipoint stage that impinge the crossflow. An instantaneous view of the jet is shown for visualization, although the streamlines correspond to the gaseous solution without the jet. As observed, the jet is fully immersed within the gas coming through the closest vane, and is not affected by the gas coming from the neighbouring vanes. The streamlines also show a high variation in the velocity magnitude along the vane width, with the highest velocity streamlines being the ones affecting the jet. The jet crossflow direction $x_c$ is also indicated in the view. Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_Umean_profile_with_jet} right shows the mean axial velocity field in the middle crossflow plane $y_c = 0$. The velocity coordinates have been transformed from the absolute coordinate system to the crossflow one, hence the axial velocity displayed $\overline{u}_c$ is the one in the crossflow direction. The arrows show the velocity profile along the crossflow vertical direction $z_c$ at a location $x_c/d_\mathrm{inj} = -0.5$, i.e. right upstream the injector (it has been shifted in the figure to allow for visual comparison with the jet). This profile, together with the $TKE$ profile along the same line, are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_gas_inlet_profiles}. A bulk gaseous velocity $u_g = 56 ~\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is obtained as the mean of the gaseous velocity profile. The TKE profile shows high values in general along all the vertical coordinate, which reflects a high turbulent state of the flow created by the swirled injector. %From the walls upwards, the $TKE$ firstly increases and then undergoes a decrease at $x_c \sim 1$ to then start augmenting again at the center of the channel.

\subsubsection*{Liquid phase}

In the operating point studied, the total liquid mass flow rate injected is $\dot{m}_{l,\mathrm{total}} = 1.64$ g s$^{-1}$. The staging parameter, defined in Eq. (\ref{eq:BIMER_staging_parameter}), is $\alpha = 15 ~\%$, meaning that amount of liquid goes through the pilot stage and $85 ~\%$ of fuel goes through the take-off. Therefore, $\dot{m}_{l,\mathrm{pilot}} = 0.25$ g s$^{-1}$ and $\dot{m}_{l,\mathrm{takeoff}} = 1.39$ g s$^{-1}$. This quantity of fuel is injected through 10 injection holes that conform the take-off stage; assuming that fuel repartition is done equally through all the channels, each injector introduces $0.139$ g s$^{-1}$ of dodecane fuel, which is equivalent to a flow rate of $Q_l = 185.3$  mm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ given the dodecane density from Table \ref{tab:dodecane_properties}. From this flow rate, the bulk liquid velocity $u_l$ can be estimated knowing an injection diameter of $d_\mathrm{inj} = 0.3$ mm:

\begin{equation}
u_l = \frac{Q_l}{\pi d_\mathrm{inj}^2 / 4} = 2.6 ~ \mathrm{m}.\mathrm{s}^{-1}
\end{equation}


The velocity profile imposed at the liquid inlet shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_liquid_injector_views} is a Poiseuille profile with the mean velocity of value $u_l$. With the estimate values for bulk liquid and gaseous velocities, the liquid properties given in Table \ref{tab:dodecane_properties} and the gaseous properties from Table \ref{tab:gaseous_operating_points_BIMER}, the momentum flux ratio $q$ and the Weber number based on the gaseous phase $We_g$ can now be calculated:

%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%q &=  \frac{\rho_l u_l^2}{\rho_g u_g^2} \approx 4 \\
%We_g &=  \frac{\rho_g d_{inj} u_g^2}{\sigma} \approx 14
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}

\begin{equation}
q =  \frac{\rho_l u_l^2}{\rho_g u_g^2} \approx 2 ~~~~ ; ~~~~  We_g =  \frac{\rho_g d_\mathrm{inj} u_g^2}{\sigma} \approx 30
\end{equation}

%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%q &=  \frac{\rho_l u_l^2}{\rho_g u_g^2} = \frac{750 \cdot 2.6^2}{0.816382 \cdot 38.05^2} = 4 \\
%We_g &=  \frac{\rho_g d_{inj} u_g^2}{\sigma} = \frac{0.816382 \cdot 0.3 mm \cdot 38.05^2}{25.35 10^{-3}} \approx 14
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}

Figure \ref{fig:location_BIMER_op_in_breakup_map} shows the BIMER JICF operating point classified in the breakup diagram of \citeColor[wu_breakup_1997], which is located in the multimode breakup regime. The governing parameters characterizing the BIMER operating point are summarized in Table \ref{tab:bimer_sps_operating_point}. The dimensionless numbers from Eqs. (\ref{eq:dimensionless_numbers_jicf}) are also calculated. Two simulations have been performed with three different element resolutions at the liquid-gas interface $\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 15, 10~\mu$m, the nomenclature for each case is given in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_resolved_simulations_performed}.

\section{Definition of liquid characteristic times}

Characteristic times can be defined for the liquid phase in BIMER in the same way it was done for the DLR JICF test case from Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}. Details on the timescales chosen and on their calculation are given in $\S$\ref{sec:ch5_liquid_characteristic_times}. Here, the definitions summarized in Table \ref{tab:jicf_characteristic times} are directly applied to the BIMER test case. The results are shown in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_SPS_characteristic times}. 

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\caption{Characteristic physical timescales [$\mu$s] in BIMER simulations}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\thickhline
\textbf{Time scale} & \textbf{Expression} & \textbf{BIMER} \\
\thickhline
Inertia & $\tau_\mathrm{in} = \frac{d_\mathrm{inj}}{u_l}$ & 115.38 \\
Aerodynamic breakup  &  $\tau_\mathrm{ab} =  \frac{d_\mathrm{inj}}{u_g - u_l} \sqrt{\frac{\rho_l}{\rho_g}} $ & 256.30 \\
Non-aerodynamic breakup  &  $\tau_\mathrm{nb} = \frac{d_\mathrm{inj}}{u_l} We_l^{1/3} $ &  453.81 \\
Capillary & $\tau_\mathrm{cap} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_l d_\mathrm{inj}^3}{8 \sigma}}$ & 318.20 \\
\thickhline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:BIMER_SPS_characteristic times}
\end{table} 

As shown in the previous table, the lower timescale is found for the inertia processes and hence those are governing breakup. Yet, all timescales are of the same order of magnitude, as opposed to the timescales of the DLR JICF summarized in Figure \ref{tab:jicf_characteristic times} where the fastest timescale (inertia) was around $100$ times smaller than the slowest (capillary). For the BIMER operating point studied, the inertia timescale is only $3$ times smaller than the capillary one, which is not even the slowest (in this case, it corresponds to the non-aerodynamic breakup timescale). The fact that the timescales in this case are closer to each other agree with the location of the BIMER operating point in the breakup diagram of Figure \ref{fig:location_BIMER_op_in_breakup_map} \citepColor[pilch_use_1987]. Besides the physical timescales, the droplets arrival times to the sampling planes depicted in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_local_FoR_and_sampling_planes}. These ones are summarized in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_SPS_characteristic_droplet_sampling_times}.

\section{Jet evolution}

The jet evolution at the early instants of the injection process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_jet_establishment}. Snapshots are shown for values of dimensionless time $t^*$ defined by Eq. (\ref{eq:t_dimensionless_with_tau_in}), in which the physical time is expressed in relation to the timescale $\tau_\mathrm{in}$ from Table \ref{tab:BIMER_SPS_characteristic times}. As in the simulations from Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}, this timescale has been chosen since is the same for all simulations and the jets depicted represent therefore equivalent instants.

Images show the features of a liquid JICF configuration: the jet leaves the injection nozzle and enters into contact with the crossflow, which has the effect of deforming the liquid column and deviating the jet towards the crossflow direction (which is represented in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_jet_establishment} by the black solid line). However, the jet topology is very different to a classical JICF configuration such as the one studied in Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}: both surface and column breakup are present (more details are given on the next section), but in BIMER column breakup creates mainly thin liquid sheets that are quickly disintegrated into small droplets (more details are given on the next section). The jet does not penetrate far and the deviation of the jet column towards the crossflow direction is not highly significant, since breakup occurs close to the injection location (as demonstrated in $\S$\ref{ch8:sec_BIMER_DC_characterization}). The low penetration is due to the low value of $q$ for this operating point, which is the parameter governing the jet penetration. The quick disintegration to low droplets and the instabilities shown along the liquid columns, which are clearly different to the column waves alanyzed in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch5_instabilities_presence} for the classical JICF configuration), are attributed to the highly turbulent state of the flow, as shown by the $TKE$ profile in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_gas_inlet_profiles}.

%\end{equation}
%
%which is actually very similar.



%\subsection{Breakup topology}

%The topology is super different with respecto to DLR JICF!! 


\subsection{Breakup topology}
\label{ch8:subsec_BIMER_breakup_topology}

Classification of the BIMER operating point considered in the breakup map of Figure \ref{fig:location_BIMER_op_in_breakup_map} estimates the regime to be comprised in the column breakup region, within the multimode breakup regime but very close to bag breakup. This regime is characterized by a mixture of breakup properties from both bag breakup, like enough spacing among column instabilities so that both bags and ligaments can be formed and lead to breakup, and shear breakup, such as surface stripping \citepColor[sallam_breakup_2004]. As in any traditional JICF, these are also expressed in terms of column and surface breakup features. Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_breakup_topology} shows these two phenoment observed in BIMER. In the first snapshot of the column breakup series, the red circle denotes the onset of an instability which propagates along the jet vertical and lateral directions. The vertical-propagating instability evolves into a thin sheet (green highlight) that eventually breaks into large liquid ligaments during primary atomization: this is the column breakup phenomenon. As in a classical JICF, these ligaments will propagate further downstream and keep on breaking. This sheet is followed by a column flattening in the lateral directions that is not typical from a classical JICF configuration (black highlight) and which modifies the ligaments produced later through column breakup. After this flattening, the process repeats again from the beginning. The lateral-propagating instabilities evolve in the surface breakup phenomenon, as illustrated in the bottom snapshots of Figure \ref{fig:location_BIMER_op_in_breakup_map}. As in the surface breakup of the canonical JICF depicted in Figure \ref{fig:jicf_surface_breakup_ug75_dx10}, two different features are highlighted: the generation of very small droplets (green highlight), whose size is of the order of the mesh resolution and will eventually disappear producing mass losses in the simulations, and the generation of small ligaments (red highlight) which break faster into smaller droplets that are later transported. Both column and surface breakup phenomena have been widely observed in traditional JICF configurations and are also captured in BIMER. What has been unexpected, though, is the onset of both phenomena through a central instability that evolves along the column vertical and sides direction, as well as the column flattening in the lateral direction. Both phenomena have been observed in both resolutions simulated and might be associated to the gaseous swirl. Nevertheless, no analysis on the breakup phenomena in liquid JICF with swirl (either in the gas or liquid phases) have been reported in literature to the knowledge of the authors, even though some analysis on swirled JICF are available on other magnitudes (\textbf{ref:XX?}).

\subsection{Jet establishment}

Esbalishment of the liquid jet in the BIMER configuration is monitored by quantifying the evolution of the number of mesh elements and the liquid volume inside the domain calculated from Eq. (\ref{eq:liquid_volume_from_levelset_definition}). Time has been non-dimensionalized with the timescale $\tau_{\mathrm{dr}_{x_c/d_\mathrm{inj}=6.67}}$ as given in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_SPS_characteristic_droplet_sampling_times}:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:t_prime_BIMER_with_tau_drx10}
%t^{\prime} = \frac{t}{\tau_{\mathrm{dr}_{x_c/d_\mathrm{inj}=10}}}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t_prime_BIMER_with_tau_drx10}
t^{\prime} = t / \tau_{\mathrm{dr}_{x_c/d_\mathrm{inj}=6.67}}
\end{equation}

Results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_volume_nelem_evolution}. Volume increase linearly at the early instants of injection due to the constant flow rate injected. At a certain point, the slope of $V_l$ starts to decrease due to droplets being removed from the simulation when reaching the sponge layer. Liquid volume shows establishment at value between $V_l = 0.75$ and $0.8$ mm$^3$. The evolution of the number of elements in the simulation shows a fast establishment for $DX15$ at a value around $60 \cdot 10^6$ elements. Case DX10 shows maximum values around $100 \cdot 10^6$ elements, and shows large magnitude oscillations due to the clusters of droplets resulting from column breakup and reaching the sponge layer at the same time instants, causing large decreases in the number of elements and small ones in the liquid volume evolution. The decreases in the number of elements are specially notorious for case DX10, which shows an abrupt decrease at the end of the simulation time from $125 \cdot 10^6$ to $90 \cdot 10^6$ elements. The time among element peaks might be associated to the frequencies of column breakup sheets/ligament shedding observed in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_breakup_topology}. Further assessing this hypothesis would need the simulations to run for longer, since these frequencies associated to column breakup are low (which are low when compared to the frequencies of droplets ejected from surface breakup) and larger simulation times would be needed. This has not done in this work due to constraints in computational resources and since the actual purpose of these simulations is the obtention of data for creating converged SLIs, which has been achieved with the physical times simulated (see $\S$\ref{sec:ch8_learning_SLI_in_BIMER})

\section{Perturbation effect ot jet dense core}
\label{ch8:sec_BIMER_DC_characterization}

As in any liquid JICF, the BIMER configuration also creates a perturbation effect from the liquid towards the gaseous phase due to the blockage effect of the liquid column. Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_jet_air_interaction_up_and_skeleton} left shows an instantaneous view of the jet perturbation effect in the plane $y_c = 0$, where the axial velocity fluctuation field $u^\prime_c$ is plotted. Large fluctuations are produced downstream the injection point due to the liquid jet. In the case of BIMER, the asymmetry in the liquid jet when compared to a traditional JICF will also create asymmetric turbulent structures in the gaseous field ($\S$\ref{subsec:ch8_turbulent_structures_BIMER}), which present a challenge to model with ALM. Regarding the dense core topology, the liquid column deforms by the action of the air from a circular cross-section up to very elongated, slender structures which correspond to the cross-section of the liquid sheet prior to breakup. Similarly to traditional JICFs, kidney-shapes cross-sections are also captured in between the injection point and the sheet. A different with respect to classical JICFs is that due to the less pronounced deviation of the jet, detection of the breakup point belonging to liquid structures which are about to shed due to column breakup might lead to axial breakup locations which are upstream the injection location (as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_jet_air_interaction_up_and_skeleton}).

\subsection{Dense core topology characterization}

In order to characterize the dense core topology, the methodology detailed in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch5_jet_dense_core_extraction} is applied. As explained, the dense core is represented by its breakup point coordinates $\left( x_b, z_b \right)$ and its width $w$. The temporal evolution of such coordinates for the simulations performed is shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_xb_zb_w_evolution}. All temporal signals display a sawtooth shape as in the case of the classical JICF signals from Figure 
\ref{fig:JICF_xb_zb_w_evolution}, with periodic behaviour of the signals which is associated to the frequencies of ligament stripping. The width signals show a periodic oscillations which in some cases reach a value $w/d_\mathrm{inj} < 1$ (i.e. dense core thinner than the injection diameter), which corresponds to the time instants where the column flattens as shown, for instance, in the snapshots of column breakup in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_breakup_topology}. The signal $x_b$ from case DX10 displays at some points a value $x_b < 0$, which indicates that the dense core breakup point has been detected upstream the injection location as shown, for instance, in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_jet_air_interaction_up_and_skeleton}.

\label{fig:BIMER_xb_zb_w_evolution}
\end{figure}

The evolution of mean quantities for all magnitudes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_DC_mean_parameters_convergence}. All cases are shown to be close to convergence. The final mean values are shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_DC_mean_parameters_scatterplots}, where the simulation UG100\_DX10 for the JICF from Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations} has been added for comparison. The location of the values in the $\overline{z}_b - \overline{x}_b$ diagram show that $\overline{z}_b > \overline{x}_b$ for both simulations, indicating that the dense core penetrates further vertically than horizontally. There is also a high dependency on resolution: refining the interface cell size does not significantly affect the vertical coordinate $\overline{z}_b$ but reduces considerably the axial breakup location $\overline{x}_b$, reducing hence the dense core length. Similarly, refining the mesh affects the dense core width $\overline{w}$ as shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_DC_mean_parameters_convergence}b.  When comparing with simulation UG100\_DX10, it is seen that both the width and the breakup coordinates are shorter for BIMER. This is coherent with the operating points simulated, since BIMER presents lower values of $q$ and $Re_g$ than the classical JICF which reduces the breakup coordinates and dense core width \citepColor[patil_liquid_2021]. The final values for the dense core length $L_\mathrm{DC} = \sqrt{\overline{x_b}^2 + \overline{z_b}^2}$ and mean width $\overline{w}$ are summarized in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_L_DC_values}.

\subsection{Turbulent structures in the gaseous field}
\label{subsec:ch8_turbulent_structures_BIMER}

The disturbance effect of the BIMER dense core towards the gaseous phase is analyzed in this section. In first place, the gaseous streamlines are shown together with the liquid jet in Figure \ref{fig:streamlines_BIMER_from_dump}. 

Compared to Figure \ref{fig:streamlines_UG100_DX20_from_dump}, 

Relevant planes to analyze the gaseous phase are shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_sps_with_gaseous_planes}.

\end{figure}

Mean axial velocity and flow streamlines in planes perpendicular to the crossflow $x_c/d_\mathrm{inj} =$ \textbf{XX} are shown in Figure \textbf{XX}. Looking at the streamlines, one of the first observations is that the classical CVP pairs typically observed in JICF configurations, visualized in the JICF configuration of DLR in Figure \ref{fig:JICF_turbulent_structures_planes_x}, are not present in BIMER. A possible explanation of missing CVPs in due to the lack of jet deflection towards the axial direction, which was notorious in the classical JICF (see for instance Figure \ref{fig:JICF_establishment_UG100_lateral}) but which is not very pronounced in BIMER, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_jet_establishment}. \citeColor[broadwell_structure_1984] argued that the strength of the CVPs is dependent on the momentum transferred to the crossflow by the jet; later, \citeColor[karagozian_analytical_1986] confirmed this statement while also showing that this momentum transfer is not relevant until the jet has been deflected by the crossflow. Since in the present results the BIMER liquid jet does not deflect to a large excent towards the crossflow direction, this hypothesis might explain the absence of CVPs found in the simulations.

\section{Direct measurement of liquid fluxes}
\label{sec:ch8_BIMER_IBs}

Resolved liquid fluxes are obtained in  interior boundaries (IBs) defined at the same location as the sampling planes from Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_local_FoR_and_sampling_planes}. The procedure followed to obtaine these fluxes was described in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch5_interior_boundaries}. Filming planes are not quantified in this case, since these fluxes are not used by the SLI models and it was shown ($\S$\ref{subsec:ch5_mass_conservation_ACLS_set_levelset_band}) that not all the mass losses in the planes perpendicular to the crossflow direction were due to liquid filming, but also to liquid structures reaching a characteristic size of the order of the mesh resolution.

In first place, the instantaneous flux for simulation DX10 are shown in Figure \ref{fig:IB_liquid_flow_rate_inst_evolution_BIMER}. In the same way as in the classical JICF (Figure \ref{fig:IB_liquid_flow_rate_inst_evolution_UG100_DX10}), the instantaneous fluxes show high oscillations around the injected flow rate due to the intermittent behaviour of the JICF: at certain instants there are cluster of droplets produced by the column breakup mechanism (see $\S$\ref{ch8:subsec_BIMER_breakup_topology}) crossing the sampling planes together, which yield instantaneous flux values larger than the injected $Q_l$ (flux overshoots); while at other instants there are only a few droplets being convected.



\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
   \includegraphics[scale=0.222]{./part3_applications/figures_ch8_resolved/flow_rates_ibs/inst_Q_iso_x_DX10}
   \vspace*{-0.20in}
\caption{Time evolution of instantaneous liquid flow rates $Q_l$ for case DX10}
\label{fig:IB_liquid_flow_rate_inst_evolution_BIMER}
\end{figure}

The evolution of the mean ($\overline{Q}_l$) and RMS ($Q_\mathrm{l,\mathrm{RMS}}$) flow rates through the IBS for all simulations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:IB_mean_RMS_Ql_evolution}. Mean fluxes (Figure \ref{fig:IB_mean_RMS_Ql_evolution} left) show oscillations at the early instants and a later stabilization to converged values. Case DX15 is converged while case DX10 shows still oscillations at the last sampling times due to the flux overshoots around $t^\prime \sim 4.2$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:IB_liquid_flow_rate_inst_evolution_BIMER}. Such overshoots are also reflected in the step increase in the RMS evolution (Figure \ref{fig:IB_mean_RMS_Ql_evolution} right) for the same case. %\hl{The coarses case DX15 shows the mean flux at the location $x_c/d_\mathrm{inj} = 0.33$, which is the closest location to the injector, to be larger than the injected mass flow rate: this is due to liquid flow recirculation at this location, since the resolution is coarse and the liquid structures emanating from the dense core stay attached to it... This recirculation has not been observed for the other two resolutions, which indicates that the interface resolution $\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 15~\mu $m is not enough to resolve BIMER}.

In all simulations, there is a decrease in the mass flux with increasing axial distance $x_c$ as it was also observed in the JICF simulations of Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}. The final mean values of the fluxes, displayed in the bar chart of Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_IB_bargraph_mean}, reflect this trend of mass flux reduction in a more visual way. The RMS values are also shown in the same graph by the vertical bars: these ones have large magnitudes, of the order of the mass flow rates obtained (see Figure \ref{fig:IB_mean_RMS_Ql_evolution}b), which indicate the high variance in the instantaneous mass flow rates crossing the sampling planes. Even so, the mean fluxes show a good evolution with values close to the injected flow rates, with reductions along the axial distance due to filming and vanishing liquid structures when reaching a size of the order of the mesh resolution, as it was demonstrated in the resolved simualtions of the JICF test case from Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}.

\section{Spray characterization}
\label{sec:ch8_BIMER_spray_char}

\subsection{Establishment of mean sprays}

Characterization of the spray resulting from atomization in BIMER is obtained through lagrangian tracking of the resulting liquid structures when these cross the sampling planes. The sampling procedure and the droplets properties obtained were described in $\S$\ref{subsec:SLI_spray_sampling}. The total physical time simulated and time for which statistics and droplets have been accumulated (i.e. after an establishment time of $t^\prime \sim 2$) are summarized in Table \ref{tab:BIMER_SLI_t_prime_accumulation}.  The total number of droplets accumulated in all sampling planes from each simulation are shown in Tabl \ref{fig:ch8_spray_char_establishment}. Even though the total number of sampled= droplets is similar in all cases, it is clearly seen by looking at $N_\mathrm{dr}/t_\mathrm{acc}$ that the fine simulation generates more droplets, as more droplets are sampled per milisecond simulated. This is in line with the effect of the resolution in the JICF of Chapter \ref{ch5:jicf_resolved_simulations}, where the observations on the effect of resolution in the sampled sprays were identical (see Table \ref{tab:jicf_SLI_Ndr_accumulated}).

Establishment of the global spray in terms of flux $Q_l$ and $SMD$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch8_spray_char_establishment}.  Flux evolution in all planes show similar trends as the IBs flow rates from Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_IB_bargraph_mean}, including a decrease in mean fluxes with axial distance due to liquid structures reaching the mesh resolution and disappearing. The evolution of SMD shows good convergence for all cases for the times simulated. The evolution of other mean quantities which are of interest for SLI are shown in Appendix \ref{app:BIMER_SLI_convergence}.

\subsection{Liquid fluxes: lagrangian versus resolved}

The final fluxes obtained through lagrangian tracking are compared to their equivalent from the IBs in the barchart from Figure \ref{fig:ch8_fluxes_bargraph_IBs_vs_LGS}. As in the previous JICF studies (Figure \ref{fig:fluxes_bargraph_IBs_vs_LGS}), there are disparities among both methodologies to obtain fluxes: sometimes the lagrangian fluxes overestimate the IBs ones due to droplets being tracked more than once, while in other cases some droplets might not be detected at all through the lagrangian method and hence the fluxes are underestimated (more details are found in $\S$\ref{subsec:ch5_sli_fluxes_vs_IBs}). Overall, lagrangian fluxes are in the same order as the resolved ones, hence these ones are kept to represent the spray (later on, spatially discretized fluxes to be injected in the dispersed phase simulations from Chapter \ref{ch9:BIMER_lagrangian} will be scaled to match the real flux injected in BIMER).

\subsection{Granulometry}
\label{ch8:subsec_spray_char_granulo}

The final SMDs obtained after the accumulation times indicated in Table \ref{fig:ch8_spray_char_establishment} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch8_spray_char_SMD_final}. The SMD has a clear dependency on the resolution: reducing the interface cell size $\Delta x_\mathrm{min}$ from 15 to 10 $\mu$m, a factor of 1.5, reduces the SMD from $\sim$ 50 to $\sim$ 35 $\mu$m, which is a reduction of the same order. SMD decreases with axial distance for both simulations. This variation is larger for DX15, where SMD decreases from 53 to 50 $\mu$m, than in DX10, where the reduction if from 36 to 35 $\mu$m. The variations are very low for both cases, indicating that either 1) the mesh resolution limit is reached or 2) atomization is complete and the smallest droplets can be captured with the interface resolutions employed. To assess both hypothesis it is of interest to look at the droplets size histograms in Figure \ref{fig:ch8_jicf_size_volume_histograms_all}.  The size and volume distributions are shown, as well as relevant sizes and the lognormal distributions (Eq. \ref{eq:ch5_f0_lognormal_distr_expression}) where the parameters have been obtained either by fit or through the correlations given by Eq. (\ref{eq:lefevbre_lognormal_fit_expressions}). The histograms from the coarse case DX15 show a clear lognormal distribution which is well fit by the blue curve. The smallest droplets sampled have a diameter $\sim 30~\mu$m, which corresponds to $2~\Delta x_\mathrm{min}$. This means that the smallest droplets in the simulation are resolved with 2 mesh cells: in general, the number of cells to properly resolved a droplet is a subject of discussion, but authors agree generally that it is comprised between 2 \citepColor[herrmann_detailed_2009] and 5 \citepColor[fuster_simulation_2009]. Therefore, in the case DX15 where smallest droplets are 2 $\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 30~\mu$m the smallest droplets simulated are therefore limited by the grid, meaning that a finer resolution than the one employed is needed to resolve the smallest physical droplets that would exist in experiments (unfortunately, there are no experimental data available to compare). When refining the mesh from $\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 15$ to 10 $\mu$m the histograms show that, actually, the smallest droplets obtained collapse also at around $\Delta x_\mathrm{min} = 30~\mu$m, which in this case corresponds to $3 \Delta x_\mathrm{min}$. Smaller diameters are not sampled: surface breakup could actually produce droplets of the order of the size resolution, but these liquid structures would disappear shortly after being generated as shown in Figure \ref{fig:BIMER_breakup_topology} (these small droplets would not greatly affect the SMD calculation due to their low volume). As a consequence, the histogram from DX10 presents a shape similar to the a lognormal distribution but which would miss the smallest diameters which are those vanishing. Furthermore, the fact that neither the SMD nor the droplet size distribution change greatly from $x_c/d_\mathrm{inj} = 5$ to $6.67$ for DX10 indicates a low level of atomization among planes. Actually, the sampling planes were chosen at the studied locations since they were outside the influence of the dense core and primary atomization region, while the second ...
