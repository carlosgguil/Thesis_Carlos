\section{General context}

In the last century, the field of aeronautics has experimented huge advances since airplanes became a fundamental tool during the World War I. The advances in military aviation during this period were followed by the apparition of the first commercial airplanes and the birth of  

The steep growth of aviation and gas turbines has also led to an 

During the last century, aviation has not stopped growing since it became a fundamental

\subsection*{Atomization process}

Explain two-phase flows phenomenology (injection + atomization) here. 

Explain airblast, hollow-cone, jicf.
